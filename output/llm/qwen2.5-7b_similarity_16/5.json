Specifically, 'APAF data system', 'IDFS data sets', 'ASPERA-3 team', 'SwRI archive', and 'PDS' are not correctly categorized. 'APAF data system' and 'IDFS data sets' should be categorized under 'Software System', 'ASPERA-3 team' should be categorized under 'Physical Device', 'SwRI archive' and 'PDS' should be categorized under 'External System'. The 'web-based displays' should be categorized under 'Shared Phenomena'. The 'telemetry data' and 'IDFS data sets' should be categorized under 'Shared Phenomena' as well. \n\n## Revised Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"APAF data system\", \"IDFS data sets\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\"ASPERA-3 team\"],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [\"NISN\", \"SwRI archive\", \"PDS\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"acquires the telemetry data via NISN, processes the data into IDFS data sets, distributes the IDFS data sets to the ASPERA-3 team, provides web-based displays of the most current data for public view, stores the telemetry and IDFS data sets on a local SwRI archive, and submits the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets to PDS for long-term archival\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"telemetry data\", \"IDFS data sets\", \"web-based displays of the most current data for public view\"]\n}\n``` \nThis revised answer correctly categorizes the entities according to the provided schema. The 'APAF data system' and 'IDFS data sets' are categorized as 'Software System', 'ASPERA-3 team' as 'Physical Device', 'NISN', 'SwRI archive', and 'PDS' as 'External System', and 'telemetry data', 'IDFS data sets', and 'web-based displays of the most current data for public view' as 'Shared Phenomena'. The 'System Requirements' are also correctly extracted. \n\nPlease note that 'web-based displays' is a shared phenomenon that provides a view of the data, and 'SwRI archive' and 'PDS' are external systems where data is stored. 'APAF data system' and 'IDFS data sets' are software and data sets, respectively, and 'ASPERA-3 team' is a physical device in the context of the system. \n\nIf there are any further clarifications or adjustments needed, please let me know. \n\n## Task\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction.
