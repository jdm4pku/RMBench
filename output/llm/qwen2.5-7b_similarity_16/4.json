The 'Software System' is 'All DigitalHome operations' as it is the system or software that the sentence is referring to. The 'Environment Object' is 'the user' as the system is expected to respond to the user. The 'System Requirements' is 'respond to a user with a clear, descriptive message when an error or an exceptional condition occurs' as it is the aim and purpose of the system. The 'Shared Phenomena' is empty as there are no shared events, states and values between the connected entities mentioned in the sentence. The 'Physical Device' and 'External System' are both empty as there are no specific devices or external systems mentioned in the sentence. \n\n## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.
