There are no mentions of environment objects, external systems, or shared phenomena in the sentence. Therefore, the answer is a JSON string with the extracted entities. ## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world. Here are some examples: the patient, the sun, the old.\n'External System': is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. Here are some examples: a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk.\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. \n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\n## Examples\nInput:The Correlator Monitor and Control System shall monitor correlator and correlator subsystem health and take corrective action autonomously to recover from hardware and computing system faults.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The Correlator Monitor and Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['monitor correlator and correlator subsystem health', 'recover from hardware and computing system faults'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:The Correlator Power Control Computer shall be a high availability type general purpose computer capable of supporting a COTS operating system and have the ability to accept a large number of external hardware status signals either directly or through external interface hardware.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['The Correlator Power Control Computer', 'external interface hardware'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['a COTS operating system'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['external hardware status signals']}\nInput:The operating system/module combination shall be capable of supporting the real-time requirements of the correlator hardware, hardware monitor/control/diagnostics with support for standalone test bench operation with simulated control data generation, and the ability to access and upgrade correlator hardware The Master Correlator Control Computer shall be a high availability type general- purpose computer capable of supporting multiple Ethernet interfaces, COTS operating systems, and support server/host services for the CMIB operating system.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:The ability to attempt recovery from failure or hot-swapped hardware devices will be built into this system.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['this system'], 'Physical Device': ['hot-swapped hardware devices'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['recovery from failure'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:This requirement is to allow correlator power monitoring and control to continue in the event of an Monitor and Control System network failure.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:Should a CMIB subsystem fail and not respond to reboot requests or other self-heal attempts, an alert notice will be issued so appropriate personnel can affect a hardware repair.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['a CMIB subsystem'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['personnel'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['a hardware repair'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['reboot requests', 'self-heal attempts', 'an alert notice']}\nInput:Due to the more hardware specific connections and controls of the Correlator Power Control Computer, actions taken by external system upon hard failures are TBD.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['the Correlator Power Control Computer'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['external system'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['actions']}\nInput:Software tools will be provided to assist the user at all access levels from system wide configuration and control to a low level CMIB command line instruction.\nAnswer:{'Software System"

The requirement is for the Correlator Power Control Computer to communicate with the Correlator Monitor and Control System, which is a system requirement. There are no physical devices, environment objects, external systems, or shared phenomena mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the answer is a JSON string with the appropriate entities and an empty list for the non-existent entity types. ## Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"the Correlator Monitor and Control System\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\"the Correlator Power Control Computer\"],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"provide a means for the Correlator Power Control Computer to communicate with the Correlator Monitor and Control System\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```"

Therefore, the correct JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis response indicates that none of the entities in the schema are present in the given sentence. The task is to extract entities that match the schema, and since no such entities are found, the list remains empty for all categories. \n\nIf you have any further sentences to analyze, feel free to provide them!"
