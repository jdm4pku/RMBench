Once the data passes the validation process, the update for that specific question is finalized.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\n## Test\nInput:Major changes to this document (e.g., changes in requirements) must be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.\nAnswer:{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\n## Explanation\nThere is no entity that matches the schema definition in the input sentence. The sentence is about changes to a document and the approval process, which does not involve any software system, physical device, environment object, external system, or shared phenomena. The sentence also does not describe the system requirements. Therefore, the answer is an empty list for all entity types. \n\n## New Test\nInput:The system should be able to communicate with the patient's medical records stored in a hospital's database to update the patient's health status.\nAnswer:{\"Software System\": [\"system\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [\"patient\"], \"External System\": [\"hospital's database\"], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\n## Explanation\nThe input sentence mentions a \"system\" which can be considered as a \"Software System\". It also mentions \"patient's medical records\" which can be considered as an \"Environment Object\". The \"hospital's database\" is an \"External System\" as it is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. The sentence does not describe any \"Physical Device\", \"System Requirements\", or \"Shared Phenomena\". Therefore, the answer is a list containing the identified entities and empty lists for the other entity types. ## New Test\nInput:The system should be able to communicate with the patient's medical records stored in a hospital's database to update the patient's health status.\nAnswer:{\"Software System\": [\"system\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [\"patient\"], \"External System\": [\"hospital's database\"], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}"
