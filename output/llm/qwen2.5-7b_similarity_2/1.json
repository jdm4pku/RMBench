The sentence describes a system requirement for the user to select a ramp meter from a list and provide information. Therefore, the entities are categorized under 'System Requirements' and 'Environment Object' (the user). The 'External System' is identified as 'a list' where the ramp meter can be selected from. The 'Shared Phenomena' is not applicable in this context. \n\n## Task\nInput:As a user, I want to be able to select a specific location from a list of locations in the system to initiate a journey.\nAnswer: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': ['a list of locations'], 'System Requirements': ['I want to be able to select a specific location from a list of locations in the system to initiate a journey'], 'Shared Phenomena': []} ## Rationale\nThe input sentence describes a user's action of selecting a specific location from a list to initiate a journey. The entities are categorized as follows:\n- **Environment Object**: \"the user\" is the entity performing the action.\n- **External System**: \"a list of locations\" is the external system from which the user selects a location.\n- **System Requirements**: The requirement is for the user to be able to select a specific location from a list of locations in the system to initiate a journey.\n\nThe 'Software System' and 'Shared Phenomena' are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, so they are left as empty lists. \n\n## Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"the user\"],\n  \"External System\": [\"a list of locations\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"I want to be able to select a specific location from a list of locations in the system to initiate a journey\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```"

    "predict": " {'Software System': ['Center-to-Center'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\n## Explanation\nThe Center-to-Center is a software system that performs normal mode operations and logs activities. The task is to identify the software system in the sentence and return it in the JSON format. The other entity types are not present in the given sentence, so they are represented by an empty list. ## Output\n{\"Software System\": [\"Center-to-Center\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}"
