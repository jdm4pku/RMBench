Therefore, the answer is an empty list for all entity types. \n\n## New Test\nInput:The system shall provide real-time data to the Ground Control Station for monitoring and control purposes.\nAnswer: {\"Software System\": [\"system\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [\"Ground Control Station\"], \"System Requirements\": [\"provide real-time data for monitoring and control purposes\"], \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"real-time data\"]} \n## Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions a \"system\" which can be considered as a software system. It also mentions the \"Ground Control Station\" as an external system that the data is provided to. The sentence also specifies the system requirement of providing real-time data for monitoring and control purposes, and the shared phenomena are the real-time data. Therefore, the answer includes the extracted entities for the specified schema. ## New Test\nInput:The system shall provide real-time data to the Ground Control Station for monitoring and control purposes.\nAnswer: {\"Software System\": [\"system\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [\"Ground Control Station\"], \"System Requirements\": [\"provide real-time data for monitoring and control purposes\"], \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"real-time data\"]} \n## Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions a \"system\" which can be considered as a software system.

The schema includes categories such as 'Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', and 'Shared Phenomena'. The goal is to identify and list all entities that match these categories in the given sentence.\n\n## Guidelines\n- The answer should be in the form of a JSON string.\n- If a category does not exist in the sentence, return an empty list for that category.\n- The schema categories are:\n  - 'Software System': refers to the system or software being discussed.\n  - 'Physical Device': refers to devices in the real world.\n  - 'Environment Object': refers to entities in the real world, such as people or objects.\n  - 'External System': refers to manually designed domains that can store data messages.\n  - 'System Requirements': refers to the aims and purposes of the system.\n  - 'Shared Phenomena': refers to shared events, states, and values between connected entities.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n\"The Tactical Control System software shall provide the UAV operator with the necessary tools for computer related communications, mission tasking, mission planning, mission execution, data receipt, data processing, and data dissemination.\"\n\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System software\", \"The Tactical Control System\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\"the UAV\"],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"operator\"],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"provide the UAV operator with the necessary tools\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"related communications\", \"mission tasking\", \"mission planning\", \"mission execution\", \"data receipt\", \"data processing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions \"The Tactical Control System software\" as the software system. \"UAV\" is identified as a physical device. \"Operator\" is identified as an environment object. The system requirement is to provide the UAV operator with necessary tools. The shared phenomena are related to communications, tasking, planning, execution, receipt, processing, and dissemination.\n\n## Test\n### Input\n\"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\"\n\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"ASPERA-3 team\"],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions \"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI\" as the software system. \"ASPERA-3 team\" is identified as an environment object.

It also mentions \"ASPERA-3 team\" as the environment object, and the system requirement is to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives. There are no physical devices, external systems, or shared phenomena mentioned in the sentence. ## Task\nThe task is to extract entities from a given sentence according to a predefined schema. The schema includes categories such as 'Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', and 'Shared Phenomena'. The goal is to identify and list all entities that match these categories in the given sentence.\n\n## Guidelines\n- The answer should be in the form of a JSON string.\n- If a category does not exist in the sentence, return an empty list for that category.\n- The schema categories are:\n  - 'Software System': refers to the system or software being discussed.\n  - 'Physical Device': refers to devices in the real world.\n  - 'Environment Object': refers to entities in the real world, such as people or objects.\n  - 'External System': refers to manually designed domains that can store data messages.\n  - 'System Requirements': refers to the aims and purposes of the system.\n  - 'Shared Phenomena': refers to shared events, states, and values between connected entities.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n\"The Tactical Control System software shall provide the UAV operator with the necessary tools for computer related communications, mission tasking, mission planning, mission execution, data receipt, data processing, and data dissemination.\"\n\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System software\", \"The Tactical Control System\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\"the UAV\"],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"operator\"],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"provide the UAV operator with the necessary tools\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"related communications\", \"mission tasking\", \"mission planning\", \"mission execution\", \"data receipt\", \"data processing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions \"The Tactical Control System software\" as the software system. \"UAV\" is identified as a physical device. \"Operator\" is identified as an environment object. The system requirement is to provide the UAV operator with necessary tools. The shared phenomena are related to communications, tasking, planning, execution, receipt, processing, and dissemination.\n\n## Test\n### Input\n\"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\"\n\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"ASPERA-3 team\"],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions \"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI\" as the software system. \"ASPERA-3 team\" is identified as an environment object. The system requirement is to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives. There are no physical devices, external systems, or shared phenomena mentioned in the sentence. ## Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\", \"ASPERA-3 team\"],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n``` ## Rationale\nThe input sentence mentions \"IDFS data access software developed by SwRI\" as the software system. \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" and \"ASPERA-3 team\" are identified as environment objects. The system requirement is to make the software available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.
