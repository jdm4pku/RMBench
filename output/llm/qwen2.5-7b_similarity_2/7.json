The keys of the JSON string are the entity types defined in the schema, and the values are lists of entities that match the corresponding entity type. If an entity type does not exist in the input sentence, the value is an empty list. The order of the entities in the list does not matter. The entities in the list should be in the same order as they appear in the input sentence. The entities should be exact matches of the words in the input sentence, and should not be modified or simplified. The answer should be a JSON string, not a Python dictionary. \n\n## Task\nInput: The system shall provide a user interface for the operator to monitor and control the system.\nAnswer: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['the operator'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['provide a user interface'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['monitor and control']}\n## Response\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\"the operator\"],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"provide a user interface\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"monitor and control\"]\n}\n```"

Here are some examples: a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk.\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. \n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\n## Examples\nInput:Science analysis software developed by SwRI to analyze IDFS-formatted data shall be made avaiable to the ASPERA=3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['ASPERA=3 Co-I’s', 'SwRI', 'the ASPERA-3 team'], 'External System': ['Science analysis software'], 'System Requirements': ['meeting mission goals and objectives'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['IDFS-formatted data']}\nInput:Science analysis software developed by SwRI to analyze IDFS-formatted data shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['ASPERA-3 Co-I’s', 'SwRI', 'the ASPERA-3 team'], 'External System': ['Science analysis software'], 'System Requirements': ['meeting mission goals and objectives'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['IDFS-formatted data']}\n\n## Test\nInput:The Service Mission Planners will consist of AMPS, AFMSS, and TAMPS.\nAnswer: {'Software System': ['AMPS', 'AFMSS', 'TAMPS'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n## Solution\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [\"AMPS\", \"AFMSS\", \"TAMPS\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n## Explanation\nIn the given input, the sentence mentions the Service Mission Planners and the systems they will consist of (AMPS, AFMSS, and TAMPS). These are identified as software systems. There is no mention of physical devices, environment objects, external systems, system requirements, or shared phenomena. Therefore, the corresponding lists for these entity types are empty.
