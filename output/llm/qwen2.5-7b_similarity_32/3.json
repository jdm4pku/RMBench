The answer should be in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Example 1\nInput: The Tactical Control System shall have ports for outputting data and imagery to an internal hard copy printer.\nOutput: {\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\n## Example 2\nInput: A DigitalHome user shall be able to read the humidity at a humidistat position.\nOutput: {\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [\"a humidistat\"], \"Environment Object\": [\"A DigitalHome user\"], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"the humidity\"]}\n\n## Example 3\nInput: The definitions section is intended to assist the technical designers as well as the client in clarifying the terms used throughout the document.\nOutput: {\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [\"the technical designers\", \"the client\"], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\n## Example 4\nInput: The Tactical Control System shall provide the capability to print waypoint data in alphanumeric format.\nOutput: {\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"waypoint data\"]}\n## Test\nInput: The system shall provide a user interface that allows the user to input data and view the results.\nOutput: {\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [\"the user\"], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"input data and view the results\"]} \nExplanation: The sentence mentions a user interface, which is part of the software system, but does not specify the software system itself. It also mentions a user, which is an environment object, and the requirement for input and viewing results, which is a system requirement. Therefore, the answer is an empty list for \"Software System\", \"Physical Device\", \"External System\", and \"System Requirements\", and an empty list for \"Shared Phenomena\" as it does not specify any shared phenomena. \n\n## Task\nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.

The sentence is about maintaining consistency between navigation components and associated content, but it does not mention any specific software system, physical device, environment object, external system, system requirements, or shared phenomena. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON list for all categories. ## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.
