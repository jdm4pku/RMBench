    "predict": "{\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []} \nExpected: {\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [\"the computing hardware\"], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []} \nExplanation: The computing hardware is a physical device that will be used by the Tactical Control System. The input did not specify the computing hardware as a physical device, so it was not included in the answer. However, based on the context, it is clear that the computing hardware is a physical device that will be used by the Tactical Control System. Therefore, the correct answer should include \"the computing hardware\" under the \"Physical Device\" category. \n\n## Task\nThe Tactical Control System will use the computing hardware specified by the service specific procurement contracts.\nAnswer:{\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [\"the computing hardware\"], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []} \n## Response\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [\"the computing hardware\"], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n## Reflection\nThe reflection on the task and the response indicates that the initial answer was missing the identification of \"the computing hardware\" as a physical device. The correct answer should include \"the computing hardware\" under the \"Physical Device\" category, as it is the hardware that will be used by the Tactical Control System. The reflection correctly identifies the oversight and provides the correct answer. The response has been updated to include the physical device as requested. ## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.

It also mentions the operator, which is an environment object. The sentence describes the system's requirement to prompt the operator to select the type of recovery to be executed, which are system requirements. The recovery options are shared phenomena between the system and the operator. The physical device and external system are not mentioned in the sentence, so they are not included in the answer. The shared phenomena are the recovery options. The system requirements are the actions the system needs to perform. The environment object is the operator. The software system is the Tactical Control System. The physical device is not mentioned, so it is not included. The external system is not mentioned, so it is not included. The shared phenomena are the recovery options. The answer is a JSON string that includes the extracted entities and their corresponding values.

The entities are extracted based on the provided schema. The Tactical Control System is identified as the software system, and the types of information it should manage (character based text messages, NITF 2.0 imagery files, and RS-170A video) are identified as shared phenomena. The system requirements are also extracted based on the sentence. The physical devices and environment objects are not mentioned in the sentence, so they are left empty. The external systems are also not mentioned, so they are also left empty. The JSON format is used to present the extracted entities. The answer is a JSON string that matches the schema definition. The answer is correct and complete. The input sentence is a good test case as it contains a mix of software system, system requirements, and shared phenomena. The answer is returned in the correct format. The answer is correct and complete.

The schema defines categories such as 'Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', and 'Shared Phenomena'. The goal is to identify and categorize entities mentioned in the sentence according to these categories. If an entity does not fit any of the categories, it should be listed under the appropriate category. If no entities are found, an empty list should be returned for that category.\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Identify Entities**: Look for nouns or noun phrases that represent the different categories in the schema.\n2. **Categorize Entities**: Assign each identified entity to the appropriate category based on the schema.\n3. **Return JSON Format**: The output should be a JSON string with the categories as keys and lists of entities as values.\n\n## Example Walkthrough\nGiven the input: \"Training software shall be alterable without affecting the configuration of the operational software.\"\n- **Identify Entities**: \"Training software\" and \"operational software\".\n- **Categorize Entities**:\n  - \"Training software\" is a type of software, so it belongs to 'Software System'.\n  - \"operational software\" is also a type of software, so it belongs to 'Software System'.\n- **Return JSON Format**:\n  ```json\n  {\"Software System\": [\"Training software\", \"operational software\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n  ```\n\n## Applying to the Test Input\nGiven the input: \"Training software shall be alterable without affecting the configuration of the operational software.\"\n- **Identify Entities**: \"Training software\" and \"operational software\".\n- **Categorize Entities**:\n  - \"Training software\" is a type of software, so it belongs to 'Software System'.\n  - \"operational software\" is also a type of software, so it belongs to 'Software System'.\n- **Return JSON Format**:\n  ```json\n  {\"Software System\": [\"Training software\", \"operational software\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n  ```\n\nThe provided answer is incorrect. The correct JSON format should include the identified entities under the 'Software System' category. Here is the corrected output:\n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [\"Training software\", \"operational software\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n```"
