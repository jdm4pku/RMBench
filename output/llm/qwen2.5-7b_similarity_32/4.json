The specific types of sensors and controllers are listed, which are all physical devices. There are no software systems, environment objects, external systems, or shared phenomena mentioned in the sentence. The system requirements are to be equipped with these devices. The sentence does not specify any particular functionality or interaction, so the system requirements are stated in a general way. The answer is formatted as a JSON string with the appropriate fields and values. The physical devices are listed as separate entries in the 'Physical Device' field. The sentence does not mention any environment objects or external systems, so those fields are left empty. The 'Shared Phenomena' field is also left empty as there is no mention of any shared events, states, or values. The answer is returned in the required JSON format.

The month plan specifies environmental parameter settings for each day and up to four daily time periods. The environmental parameters include temperature, humidity, contact sensors, and power switches. The sentence does not mention any software system, physical device, environment object, external system, or shared phenomena other than the user and the environmental parameters. Therefore, the answer is an empty list for 'Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', and 'System Requirements', and the environmental parameters are listed under 'Shared Phenomena'. The 'System Requirements' field is populated with the requirement statement. The JSON format is used to present the answer. The sentence is parsed and the relevant entities are extracted and categorized according to the schema definition. The answer is returned in the required format. The answer is correct and complete.
