Therefore, both instances of \"Tactical Control System\" are categorized under 'Software System'. There are no mentions of Physical Devices, Environment Objects, External Systems, System Requirements, or Shared Phenomena in the sentence. Hence, the corresponding lists are empty.

Therefore, the 'Software System' category includes both instances of \"Tactical Control System.\" The other categories (Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena) are empty as there are no other entities mentioned in the sentence. The requirement itself is about the system's ability to integrate with itself, so the 'System Requirements' category is filled with the requirement statement. ## \n## Task\nThe Tactical Control System shall provide the necessary hardware and software functionality to allow the Tactical Control System to integrate with the Tactical Control System.\nAnswer: {\"Software System\": [\"The Tactical Control System\", \"the Tactical Control System\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [\"to allow the Tactical Control System to integrate with the Tactical Control System\"], \"Shared Phenomena\": []} \n## Explanation\nThe sentence is a repetition of the same entity, \"Tactical Control System,\" and it is describing the requirement for the system to integrate with itself.

Therefore, they are listed under \"Environment Object\". The \"outside world\" and \"correlator hardware systems\" are not explicitly mentioned, so they are not included in the entities extracted. The \"monitor or control interface\" is a functionality rather than an entity, so it is not included in the \"System Requirements\". The \"bulk of the monitor or control interface with the outside world\" and \"concerned with the correlator hardware systems under their direct control\" are descriptions of the roles' responsibilities, which do not fit into the predefined categories. Hence, the output is an empty list for all entity types except \"Environment Object\". ##"

The sentence is about making practical use of available hot swappable devices and components, but it does not specify any particular software system, physical device, environment object, external system, or system requirements. The phrase \"shared phenomena\" also does not apply in this context as there are no shared events, states, or values mentioned. Therefore, the answer is an empty JSON object. \n\n## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.
