It also refers to the player's overall score and choices made during gameplay, which are shared phenomena. The narrative conclusion and educational achievements are also shared phenomena as they are tied to the player's actions and score. ##\n\n## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.

Here are some examples: a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk.\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. \n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\n## Examples\nInput:Each link displayed on the map shall be color coded to provide a graphical depiction of speeds.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the map', 'Each link'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['to provide a graphical depiction of speeds'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': ['Each presentation segment'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['a clear and sufficient indication']}\nInput:highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:Annotation includes operator generated comments as well as graphics which are superimposed on the imagery.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['operator'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['Annotation', 'comments', 'graphics']}\nInput:It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['important information', 'links to information']}\n\n## Test\nInput:The system shall provide a user interface that allows the user to input data and view the results.\nAnswer: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['to allow the user to input data and view the results'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n## Rationale\nThe sentence mentions the user, which is an environment object.
