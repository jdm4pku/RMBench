The keys of the JSON string are the entity types defined in the schema, and the values are lists of entities that match the corresponding entity type. If an entity type does not exist in the input sentence, the value is an empty list. The answer is derived by carefully analyzing the input sentence and identifying the entities that match the defined entity types. In the given example, the input sentence mentions the Master Correlator Control Computer, correlator hardware, hardware monitor/control/diagnostics, COTS operating systems, and server/host services for the CMIB operating system, which are all software systems or physical devices. The sentence also mentions the real-time requirements, standalone test bench operation, and access and upgrade of correlator hardware, which are system requirements. There are no environment objects, external systems, or shared phenomena mentioned in the input sentence.\n\n## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.

It only describes a system requirement related to transparency. Therefore, the answer is an empty list for 'Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', and 'External System', and the system requirement is described in the 'System Requirements' field. The 'Shared Phenomena' field is also empty as there are no shared events, states, or values mentioned. \n\n## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world.

Here are some examples: a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk.\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. \n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\n## Examples\nInput:The DigitalHome web system shall provide for authentication and information encryption through a recognized reliable and effective security technology, such as Transport Layer Security.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The DigitalHome web system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['authentication and information encryption']}\nInput:All hardware, software, documentation, and sensitive information processed by Tactical Control System shall be physically protected, minimally at the level determined by the risk index computed in to prevent intentional as well as unintentional disclosure, destruction, and modification.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['physically protected'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:The CCTNS system should ensure high standards of security and access control through do not allow hard delete and perform only soft tagging the row for deletion.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The CCTNS system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['ensure high standards of security and access control'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:The CCTNS system should ensure high standards of security and access control through encoding the incoming data or user request.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The CCTNS system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['ensure high standards of security and access control'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['the incoming data', 'user request']}\nInput:Functions, except for software upgrade and software debug, under the Maintenance Operations Mode shall operate concurrently without precluding or excluding any of the other functions in accordance with allowable operations as determined by the appropriate levels of interaction.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:This functionality, as a minimum, shall include: formatting, storing, internally routing, and recording the video [SSS190]; creating and storing a freeze frame of the video [SSS191]; retrieving and displaying the video [SSS192]; printing a hard copy of freeze frame video [SSS193]; and processing digital imagery for export and dissemination [SSS194].\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['video', 'video', 'hard copy'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['formatting, storing, internally routing, and recording the video [SSS190]; creating and storing a freeze frame of the video [SSS191]; retrieving and displaying the video [SSS192]; printing a hard copy of freeze frame video [SSS193]; and processing digital imagery for export and dissemination [SSS194]'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['digital imagery']}\nInput:All DigitalHome operations shall incorporate exception handling so that the system responds to a user with"
