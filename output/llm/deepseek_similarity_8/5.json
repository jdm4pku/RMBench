The entities to extract are based on the provided schema. The entities are identified by their type and their occurrence in the text. If an entity type does not appear in the text, it should be represented by an empty list. The output should be a JSON string with the keys as per the schema and the values as lists of matching entities.\n\nSo, in the given input, the sentence is: \"This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) identifies the requirements for the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) ground data system for the Mars Express mission.\"\n\nFirst, we need to identify the 'Software System' entity. The sentence mentions \"the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) ground data system\", which is clearly a software system. So, this is added to the 'Software System' list.\n\nNext, we look for 'Physical Device'. The sentence does not mention any physical devices, so this list remains empty.\n\n'Environment Object' is another category. The sentence refers to the \"Mars Express mission\", but this is more of a mission name rather than an environment object. Therefore, no environment objects are identified.\n\n'External System' is about manually designed domains that store data messages. The sentence doesn't mention any external systems, so this list is empty.\n\n'System Requirements' are the aims and purposes of the system. While the SRS identifies requirements, the specific requirements are not listed here, so this list is empty.\n\nLastly, 'Shared Phenomena' refers to shared events or states. The sentence doesn't discuss any shared phenomena, so this list is also empty.\n\nThus, the final JSON output includes only the 'Software System' with the identified entity and all other categories as empty lists.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': ['the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) ground data system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}"

    "predict": " \n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['Mars Express'], 'Environment Object': ['instrument package', 'Mars Express mission', 'European Space Agency (ESA)'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to extract entities from the given sentence. The task is to identify all entities that match the defined schema. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"The ASPERA-3 instrument package will be flown on the Mars Express mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and will be launched in June 2003 according to the current schedule.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence into parts to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: This refers to the system or software being developed. In the sentence, I don't see any specific software systems mentioned. The ASPERA-3 is an instrument package, not a software system. So, this category should be empty.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: This is a real-world device used to send or receive data. The sentence mentions \"Mars Express\" and \"instrument package.\" Mars Express is a spacecraft, so it's a physical device. The instrument package is part of the spacecraft, so it's also a physical device. So, Physical Device should include both Mars Express and instrument package.\n\nWait, but the schema defines Physical Device as a device in the real world used to get/send/receive data. The instrument package is part of the spacecraft, which is a physical device. So, both are physical devices.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: This is an entity in the real world. The sentence mentions \"Mars Express mission\" and \"European Space Agency (ESA).\" Mars Express is a spacecraft, so it's an environment object. The mission is a set of activities, but I'm not sure if it's considered an environment object. The ESA is an organization, which is an environment object. So, Environment Object includes Mars Express mission and ESA.\n\nWait, the examples show that \"operator\" was considered an environment object. So, mission and ESA are both environment objects.\n\n4. **External System**: This is a manually designed domain that stores data messages. The sentence doesn't mention any external systems like databases or communication systems. So, this category is empty.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: These are the aims and purposes of the system. The sentence talks about the instrument package being flown and launched, but doesn't specify any system requirements. So, this category is empty.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: This refers to shared events or states. The sentence mentions the launch in June 2003. That's a specific event, so it's shared phenomena.\n\nNow, compiling all these:\n\n- Software System: []\n- Physical Device: Mars Express, instrument package\n- Environment Object: Mars Express mission, ESA\n- External System: []\n- System Requirements: []\n- Shared Phenomena: launch in June 2003\n\nWait, but in the examples, sometimes the launch time is considered shared phenomena. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final JSON should reflect these entities in their respective categories.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['Mars Express', 'instrument package'], 'Environment Object': ['Mars Express mission', 'European Space Agency (ESA)'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['launch in June 2003']}"

    "predict": " {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['ASPERA-3'], 'Environment Object': ['particles', 'neutral atoms', 'fields', 'near Martian environment'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to extract entities from the given sentence. The task is to identify all the entities that match the schema provided. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each of these has specific definitions, so I need to make sure I correctly identify which category each entity falls into.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"ASPERA-3 contains a number of different sensors that will measure the particles, neutral atoms, and fields in the near Martian environment.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: This is the system or software being developed. In the sentence, the only system mentioned is \"ASPERA-3.\" However, from the examples, it seems that \"ASPERA-3\" is a physical device, not a software system. So, I don't think \"ASPERA-3\" falls into Software System.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: This refers to a device in the real world used to send or receive data. The sentence mentions \"sensors\" and \"ASPERA-3.\" Since sensors are devices, and \"ASPERA-3\" is a spacecraft that carries sensors, both could be considered physical devices. However, in the examples, \"ASPERA-3\" was considered a Physical Device, so I'll include it here.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: These are entities in the real world, like the patient, sun, etc. The sentence mentions \"particles,\" \"neutral atoms,\" \"fields,\" and \"near Martian environment.\" All of these are parts of the environment around Mars, so they should be classified as Environment Objects.\n\n4. **External System**: This is a manually designed domain, like a database or card. The sentence doesn't mention any external systems, so this category will be empty.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: These are the aims of the system. The sentence doesn't specify any requirements, so this category is empty.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: These are shared events or states between entities. The sentence talks about measuring particles, atoms, and fields, which are data points that can be shared. So, \"particles,\" \"neutral atoms,\" \"fields,\" and \"near Martian environment\" could also be shared phenomena.\n\nWait, but in the examples, when a device was mentioned, it was categorized under Physical Device, and the environment elements were under Environment Object. So, I need to make sure I'm not double-counting. The sentence says that the sensors will measure particles, etc., so the particles and fields are what the sensors measure, which would be shared phenomena.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- **Physical Device**: ASPERA-3 and the sensors.\n- **Environment Object**: Particles, neutral atoms, fields, near Martian environment.\n- **Shared Phenomena**: Particles, neutral atoms, fields, near Martian environment.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the sensors were considered a Physical Device, and the environment elements were Environment Objects. So, I think I need to categorize them accordingly.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- **Physical Device**: ASPERA-3 (since it's a spacecraft) and the sensors (as they are devices).\n- **Environment Object**: Particles, neutral atoms, fields, near Martian environment.\n- **Shared Phenomena**: The data being measured, which would be the particles, atoms, fields, and environment.\n\nWait, but in the example, when the sentence was about processing data from EO, IR, SAR payloads, the entities were categorized as Physical Devices (EO, IR, SAR) and the data as Shared Phenomena. So, in this case, the sensors are the devices, and the data they measure is the shared phenomena.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- **Physical Device**: ASPERA-3 and the sensors.\n- **Environment Object**: The environment is the near Martian environment, but the particles, atoms, fields are part of that environment, so they are Environment Objects.\n- **Shared Phenomena**: The data being measured, which is the particles, atoms, fields, and environment.\n\nWait, but in the example, the EO, IR, SAR were considered Physical Devices, and the data was Shared Phenomena. So, similarly, the sensors are Physical Devices, and the data they collect (particles, etc.) is Shared Phenomena.\n\nSo, the categories would be:\n\n- **Software System**: None, as ASPERA-3 is a device.\n- **Physical Device**: ASPERA-3 and the sensors.\n- **Environment Object**: Particles, neutral atoms, fields, near Martian"

So why is it not being captured?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the schema. The schema defines 'External System' as a manually designed domain that can store data messages. Examples include a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk. So, 'Instrument Data File Set (IDFS)' is a data structure, not a physical device. It's a collection of data files, so it's an external system because it's a domain that can store data. Therefore, it should be categorized under 'External System'.\n\nBut in the test input, it's not being captured. So perhaps the system is not recognizing it as an external system. Maybe the way it's written is causing the issue. Let me think about how to extract it.\n\nThe input is: \"These data products will be put into a form known as the Instrument Data File Set (IDFS).\"\n\nSo, the entity here is 'Instrument Data File Set (IDFS)'. According to the schema, this should be an 'External System'. So in the output, it should be under 'External System' as a list with one element.\n\nBut in the test case, the output is all empty lists. So perhaps the system is not recognizing it as an external system. Maybe the system is treating it as an environment object or something else.\n\nWait, the schema defines 'Environment Object' as an entity in the real world, like the patient, the sun, the old. So 'Instrument Data File Set' is a data structure, not a physical object. Therefore, it's more likely an 'External System' because it's a domain that can store data messages.\n\nSo, the correct output should have 'External System' as ['Instrument Data File Set (IDFS)'].\n\nBut in the test case, it's not captured. So perhaps the system is not correctly identifying it. Maybe the system is looking for specific patterns or context clues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system is considering 'Instrument Data File Set (IDFS)' as a software system because it's a data structure. But according to the schema, 'Software System' is the system or software being developed. 'External System' is a manually designed domain that can store data messages.\n\nWait, the 'Software System' is the system being developed, like the Tactical Control System. 'External System' is a separate system, like a database or a card. So 'Instrument Data File Set' is a data structure, which is an external system.\n\nTherefore, the correct extraction should be:\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['Instrument Data File Set (IDFS)'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nBut in the test case, it's not captured. So perhaps the system is not recognizing it because it's not explicitly defined as an external system in the text.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is looking for more context. For example, if 'IDFS' is used as a data format, it might be considered a physical device or something else.\n\nWait, in the examples, 'compact disk' is considered a physical device. 'CD-ROM drive' is a physical device. So 'Instrument Data File Set' is a collection of data files, not a physical device. Therefore, it's an external system.\n\nSo, the correct output should include it under 'External System'.\n\nBut in the test case, it's not included. So perhaps the system is not correctly identifying it. Maybe the system is treating it as a software system or environment object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system is not considering it because it's not explicitly named as an external system in the text.\n\nWait, the schema defines 'External System' as a manually designed domain that can store data messages.

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions, so I need to apply those to the input.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"The ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) is a ground data system responsible for processing all of the ASPERA-3 telemetry.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: The sentence mentions \"The ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF)\" and describes it as a ground data system. Since a software system is defined as the system or software to be developed, APAF fits here.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices like hardware components. So, this category should be empty.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: Environment Objects are real-world entities. The sentence talks about ASPERA-3 telemetry, which is data, but not a physical object. So, no environment objects here.\n\n4. **External System**: External systems are manually designed domains that store data, like databases. The sentence refers to ASPERA-3, but it's part of the system being discussed, not an external system. So, this category is empty.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence states what the system does, like processing telemetry, but it doesn't specify the requirements. The requirements are the aim or purpose, which isn't directly mentioned here. So, this category is empty.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: This refers to shared events or states. The sentence mentions \"telemetry,\" which is data transmitted. Since telemetry is data, it's a shared phenomenon between entities. So, 'telemetry' is added here.\n\nNow, I'll map these to the JSON structure. Each category should have a list of matching entities. If none match, it's an empty list.\n\nSo, the final JSON should have 'Software System' with APAF, and 'Shared Phenomena' with telemetry. All other categories remain empty.\n\nI think that's all.

The task is to identify all entities that match the defined schema. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions, so I need to carefully parse the sentence to see which entities fit into these categories.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"The APAF data system acquires the telemetry data via NISN, processes the data into IDFS data sets, distributes the IDFS data sets to the ASPERA-3 team, provides web-based displays of the most current data for public view, stores the telemetry and IDFS data sets on a local SwRI archive, and submits the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets to PDS for long-term archival.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence into parts to identify each entity.\n\n1. **Software System**: The sentence starts with \"The APAF data system.\" That's clearly a software system, so that's one entity.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: I'm looking for devices used to get, send, or receive data. The sentence mentions \"NISN\" and \"SwRI archive.\" Wait, NISN might be a network or a system, not a physical device. SwRI archive is a storage system, which is more of an External System. So maybe there are no physical devices here.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: These are real-world entities. The sentence mentions \"NISN,\" \"ASPERA-3 team,\" \"PDS,\" and \"SwRI archive.\" Wait, NISN might be a system, not an environment object. ASPERA-3 team and PDS are teams and systems, so they might be External Systems. SwRI archive is a storage system, so again, External System. So perhaps \"NISN\" is an External System? Or maybe it's an Environment Object. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the definition says Environment Object is an entity in the real world, like the patient, sun, old. So NISN is a data system, which is more of an External System. So maybe there are no Environment Objects here.\n\n4. **External System**: Let's look for systems that are manually designed and store data. The sentence mentions NISN, ASPERA-3 team, PDS, and SwRI archive. NISN is a data system, so External System. ASPERA-3 team is a team, but they might be using an external system. PDS is a data archive, so External System. SwRI archive is a storage system, so External System. So these are all External Systems.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence describes what the system does, like acquiring, processing, distributing data. But the System Requirements are the aims or purposes. The sentence doesn't state any specific requirements like \"shall be able to\" or \"shall support.\" So probably no System Requirements here.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: These are shared events or data. The sentence mentions telemetry data, IDFS data sets, most current data, telemetry and IDFS data sets. These are all data that are shared, so they fit into Shared Phenomena.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The sentence says the APAF data system acquires telemetry data via NISN.

So, 'ASPERA-3' is definitely a Software System.\n\nNext, the sentence lists several components: DPU, ELS, etc. These are all physical devices used in the spacecraft. So, each of these should be under Physical Device.\n\nThen, it mentions orbit and attitude data from the spacecraft. Orbit and attitude data are information, so they might fall under Shared Phenomena since they are data shared between entities.\n\nLooking at the categories:\n\n- Software System: Only ASPERA-3 fits here.\n- Physical Device: All the components listed (DPU, ELS, etc.) are physical devices.\n- Environment Object: The sentence doesn't mention any real-world objects like patients or sun, so this should be empty.\n- External System: There's no mention of external systems like databases, so this is empty.\n- System Requirements: The sentence doesn't specify any requirements, so empty.\n- Shared Phenomena: The orbit and attitude data are shared, so they go here.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me double-check each category.\n\nSoftware System: Only ASPERA-3 is mentioned, so that's correct.\n\nPhysical Device: All the components listed after ASPERA-3 are devices, so they are all included.\n\nEnvironment Object: No real-world entities are mentioned, so empty.\n\nExternal System: No external systems are referenced, so empty.\n\nSystem Requirements: No requirements are stated, so empty.\n\nShared Phenomena: The data from the spacecraft is shared, so that's included.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"ASPERA-3\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\n    \"Data Processing Unit(DPU)\",\n    \"Electron Spectrometer(ELS)\",\n    \"Ion Mass Analyzer(IMA)\",\n    \"Neutral Particle Detector(NPD)\",\n    \"Neutral Particle Imager(NPI)\",\n    \"Scanning Unit(SU)\",\n    \"Orbit/Attitude(OA)\"\n  ],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"orbit and attitude data\"]\n}\n```"

The task is to identify all entities that match the defined schema. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"Each of the seven components described above will have an associated Software Design Document (SDD) that will define and fully describe all of the data products contained within each individual virtual instrument.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: Looking for systems or software. The sentence mentions \"Software Design Document (SDD)\" and \"virtual instrument.\" SDD is a document, not a system, but \"virtual instrument\" might be a physical device. Wait, no, \"virtual instrument\" is more like a software component. So SDD is a document, which might fall under External System or System Requirements. Hmm, but the sentence says each component will have an SDD. So the SDD is a document, which is an External System because it's a manually designed domain storing data. So \"Software Design Document (SDD)\" is an External System.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: The sentence mentions \"virtual instrument.\" Virtual instruments are software-based, so maybe not a physical device. So Physical Device might be empty here.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: The sentence doesn't mention any real-world entities like patients or other objects, so this should be empty.\n\n4. **External System**: As I thought earlier, SDD is a document, which is an External System. So \"Software Design Document (SDD)\" is added here.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence talks about defining data products, which are part of the system's requirements. So \"define and fully describe all of the data products\" is a System Requirement.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: The sentence doesn't mention any shared events or states between entities, so this is empty.\n\nWait, but the sentence also says \"Each of the seven components described above.\" That's a group of components, which might be part of the Software System. So \"Each of the seven components described above\" refers to the software components, so they are part of the Software System.\n\nSo compiling this:\n\n- Software System: \"Each of the seven components described above\" and the part about the SDD, but wait, SDD is an External System. So only the components are part of the Software System.\n\nWait, no. The sentence says each component will have an SDD. So the components are part of the Software System, and the SDD is an External System.\n\nSo the Software System is \"Each of the seven components described above will have an associated Software Design Document (SDD)...\" Wait, no, the Software System is the system itself, which is the collection of components. So the Software System is the system, and the components are part of it.\n\nWait, the sentence starts with \"Each of the seven components described above...\" So the components are part of the Software System. So the Software System is the system that includes these components. So the Software System would be the entire system, but the components are part of it. However, in the examples, sometimes the entire system is listed as a Software System, and components as part of it.\n\nLooking at the examples, in the first example, \"The Tactical Control System core software\" is the Software System, and \"Outrider and Predator UAVs\" are Physical Devices.\n\nIn the test case provided earlier, the answer included \"Each of the seven components described above\" as part of Software System. So in this case, the Software System is the collection of components, and each component has an SDD.\n\nSo in this case, the Software System is \"Each of the seven components described above will have an associated Software Design Document (SDD)...\", but that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, the Software System is the system, and the components are part of it. So"

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions, so I need to carefully parse the sentence to see which entities fit into each category.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"The APAF ground data system is to provide data processing algorithms and support to IRF for the ASPERA-3 science team (including Co-I’s) in preparation for the Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) phase of the Mars Express mission.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence into parts to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: The sentence starts with \"The APAF ground data system.\" That's clearly a software system. So, I'll add \"APAF ground data system\" to the Software System list.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices like sensors or hardware. So, this category will be empty.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: Looking for entities in the real world. The sentence mentions \"IRF,\" \"ASPERA-3 science team,\" and \"Co-I’s.\" These are all groups or entities involved in the mission. So, these go into Environment Object.\n\n4. **External System**: The sentence refers to \"Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) phase\" and \"Mars Express mission.\" These are phases and the mission itself, which are external systems. So, these are added to External System.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence talks about what the system is supposed to provide, like \"data processing algorithms and support.\" These are the requirements, so they go into System Requirements.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: The shared phenomena here would be the data being processed, the support provided, and the phases of the mission. So, \"data processing algorithms,\" \"support,\" \"Mission Operations and Data Analysis phase,\" \"Mars Express mission,\" and \"MO&DA phase\" are all shared phenomena.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other entities. Let me go through the sentence again.\n\n- \"APAF ground data system\" is the software system.\n- \"IRF\" is an external entity, part of the ASPERA-3 team.\n- \"ASPERA-3 science team\" and \"Co-I’s\" are environment objects.\n- \"Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) phase\" and \"Mars Express mission\" are external systems.\n- The functions like data processing and support are system requirements.\n- The data and phases are shared phenomena.\n\nI think that's all.

So the output should be all empty lists.\n\nBut wait, the sentence is: \"validation and archiving of all ASPERA-3 scientific data in the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) within 6 months of receipt in a form useable by the general scientific community is to be provided by the APAF.\"\n\nSo, the entities are:\n\n- Software System: The system being discussed is the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS).

So PDS is a software system, not an external system.\n\n- System Requirements: The requirement is that the data is validated and archived, so 'validation and archiving' is a system requirement.\n\n- Shared Phenomena: The data is scientific data, which is shared between systems.\n\nWait, but in the test input, the output was all empty lists. But according to this analysis, 'Software System' should have PDS, 'System Requirements' should have 'validation and archiving', and 'Shared Phenomena' should have 'scientific data'.\n\nBut the test input's expected output is all empty lists. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the schema.\n\nWait, looking back at the schema:\n\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information.\n\n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world. Examples: patient, sun, old.\n\n'External System': is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. Examples: database, magnetic stripe card, tap, hard disk.\n\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed.\n\n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\nIn the test input, the sentence is about the process of validation and archiving of data. The software system is PDS. The system requirement is that this validation and archiving is done.

So perhaps the test input is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the software system is 'the APAF' because it's the one providing the service.

So \"External Device\" is not part of the schema. So in the answer, it should be ignored.

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. The schema includes categories like Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena.\n\nFirst, let's read the input sentence carefully: \"The APAF system shall acquire from ESOC the telemetry data of the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude to automatically process the data on a daily basis.\"\n\nI'll break it down into parts to identify each entity type.\n\n1. **Software System**: The sentence starts with \"The APAF system.\" So, APAF system is definitely a Software System. That's straightforward.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: Looking for devices that send or receive data. The sentence mentions \"telemetry data,\" but that's more about data rather than a physical device. There's no mention of specific hardware like sensors or transmitters here. So, I think Physical Device is empty.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: These are real-world entities. The sentence refers to \"ASPERA-3 Experiment\" and \"Mars Express Orbit/Attitude.\" These are experiments and orbits, which are environment objects. So, I'll list those.\n\n4. **External System**: This is a manually designed system that stores data. The sentence says \"ESOC\" which is an external system that provides data. So, ESOC is an External System.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence mentions what the system shall do, like \"acquire...telemetry data...to automatically process the data on a daily basis.\" This describes the system's purpose, so it fits System Requirements.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: This refers to shared events or data. The sentence talks about \"telemetry data\" being acquired and processed. So, \"telemetry data\" is the shared phenomena.\n\nNow, compiling all these:\n\n- Software System: ['APAF system']\n- Physical Device: []\n- Environment Object: ['ASPERA-3 Experiment', 'Mars Express Orbit/Attitude']\n- External System: ['ESOC']\n- System Requirements: ['acquire from ESOC the telemetry data of the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude to automatically process the data on a daily basis']\n- Shared Phenomena: ['telemetry data', 'telemetry data']\n\nWait, the Shared Phenomena has two entries of 'telemetry data.' Is that correct? The schema example had two entries for 'telemetry data' in one of the answers. So, I think that's acceptable.\n\nDouble-checking each category to ensure nothing is missed. The sentence doesn't mention any other systems or devices beyond what's already listed. The requirements are clearly stated as the system's function. Environment Objects are correctly identified as the experiments and orbits. External System is correctly noted as ESOC.\n\nI think that's all. So, the final JSON should reflect these findings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"APAF system\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"ASPERA-3 Experiment\", \"Mars Express Orbit/Attitude\"],\n  \"External System\": [\"ESOC\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"acquire from ESOC the telemetry data of the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude to automatically process the data on a daily basis\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"telemetry data\", \"telemetry data\"]\n}\n```"

So, perhaps the correct extraction is 'ASPERA-3 science data' and 'IDFS data sets' as separate entities. But in the example, it's considered as a single entity. Hmm, maybe I need to think about how to parse this.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, in the first example, the input was about compliance with various standards, and the answer had 'Shared Phenomena' as an empty list. Then in the second example, the input was about processing data from EO, IR, SAR payloads, and the answer included 'payload product data' as the shared phenomena. So, in that case, the data being processed is considered the shared phenomenon.\n\nIn the test input, the sentence is: \"The APAF system shall process all ASPERA-3 science data into IDFS data sets.\" So, the system (APAF) is the software system.

The action of processing is the shared phenomenon.\n\nWait, but according to the schema, 'Shared Phenomena' is a set of shared events, states, and values between connected entities. So, in this case, the processing is an action that connects the APAF system (software system) with the ASPERA-3 data and the IDFS data sets. So, the shared phenomena would be the data being processed and the resulting data sets.\n\nBut in the example given, the answer includes 'ASPERA-3 science data into IDFS data sets' as the shared phenomenon. So, perhaps the system is processing the data, and the data sets are the result, so the entire phrase is considered the shared phenomenon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'Shared Phenomena' is the data that is being shared between the system and the external systems. So, in this case, the data being processed is the shared phenomenon.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input was about processing data from EO, IR, SAR payloads, and the answer included 'payload product data' as the shared phenomenon. So, the data being processed is the shared phenomenon.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, the data being processed is the ASPERA-3 science data, and the result is the IDFS data sets. So, perhaps both are considered as environment objects, and the shared phenomenon is the action of processing.\n\nBut in the example, the answer includes 'ASPERA-3 science data into IDFS data sets' as the shared phenomenon. So, perhaps the entire phrase is considered the shared phenomenon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'Shared Phenomena' is the data that is being transferred or shared between systems. So, in this case, the data being processed is the shared phenomenon.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the schema again. 'Shared Phenomena' is a set of shared events, states, and values between connected entities. So, in the test input, the APAF system is processing the ASPERA-3 data into IDFS data sets. So, the data being processed is the shared phenomenon, and the resulting data sets are also part of the shared phenomena.\n\nBut in the example, the answer includes 'ASPERA-3 science data into IDFS data sets' as the shared phenomenon. So, perhaps the entire phrase is considered a single shared phenomenon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'Shared Phenomena' is the data that is being transferred or shared between the system and other entities. So, in this case, the data being processed is the shared phenomenon.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the 'Shared Phenomena' is the data that is being passed between the system and other entities. So, in the test input, the system is processing the ASPERA-3 data into IDFS data sets, which are then shared with other systems. So, the shared phenomena would be the ASPERA-3 data and the IDFS data sets.\n\nBut in the example, the answer includes 'ASPERA-3 science data into IDFS data sets' as the shared phenomenon.

    "predict": " \n{'Software System': ['The APAF system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['engineering and ancillary information', 'IDFS data sets']}\n\nWait, but in the example, the answer is:\n{'Software System': ['The APAF system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['engineering and ancillary information', 'IDFS data sets']}\n\nBut according to the schema, 'System Requirements' is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. So in this input, the sentence is about what the system does, not the requirements. So the 'System Requirements' should be empty.\n\nBut in the example, the answer includes 'System Requirements' as empty. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: The input is \"The APAF system shall process the engineering and ancillary information necessary for calibration and science validation into IDFS data sets.\"\n\nSo, let's parse this sentence.\n\nFirst, identify the software system: The APAF system.\n\nThen, look for physical devices: None in the sentence.\n\nEnvironment objects: None.\n\nExternal systems: None.\n\nSystem requirements: The sentence is about what the system does, not what it needs to be. So no system requirements.\n\nShared phenomena: The data processed is 'engineering and ancillary information' and the output is 'IDFS data sets'. So these are shared phenomena.\n\nSo the correct answer is as given.\n\nAnother test case: \"The Tactical Control System shall be in compliance with Common Imagery Ground Surface Station (CIGSS), United States Imagery Standards (USIS), Video Working Group Standards Architecture, National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) Version 2.0, and Global Command Control Systems (GCCS) when processing payload imagery data.\"\n\nIn this case, the software system is 'The Tactical Control System'. The sentence lists several standards, which are external systems. So 'External System' would include CIGSS, USIS, Video Working Group Standards Architecture, NITF, and GCCS. But wait, according to the schema, 'External System' is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. Standards are more like constraints, not external systems. So perhaps they are not considered as external systems. So in this case, 'External System' would be empty, and 'Shared Phenomena' would be the processing of payload imagery data.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the answer for this input is:\n\n{'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother example: \"The Tactical Control System data sensitivities shall be determined by the data sensitivities of the systems with which it interfaces, to including the air vehicles, payloads, and C4I systems.\"\n\nHere, the software system is 'The Tactical Control System data' (wait, no, the software system is the system, not the data. Wait, the sentence says 'The Tactical Control System data sensitivities...' So the software system is 'The Tactical Control System'. The 'data sensitivities' is part of the system's data. So in the answer, 'Software System' is ['The Tactical Control System'], and 'the systems' refers to the systems it interfaces with, which are 'air vehicles', 'payloads', and 'C4I systems'. So 'Environment Object' would be 'air vehicles' and 'payloads', and 'External System' would be 'C4I systems'. 'System Requirements' is the aim, which is 'determined by the data sensitivities of the systems', so that's included. 'Shared Phenomena' is the data sensitivities.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': ['air vehicles'], 'Environment Object': ['payloads'], 'External System': ['C4I systems'], 'System Requirements': ['determined by the data sensitivities of the systems'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['data sensitivities']}\n\nWait, but in the example given, the answer is:\n\n{'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System data', 'the systems'], 'Physical Device': ['the air vehicles'], 'Environment Object': ['payloads'], 'External System': ['C4I systems'], 'System Requirements': ['determined by the data sensitivities of the systems'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nWait, that's different. So in that example, 'Software System' includes both 'The Tactical Control System data' and 'the systems', which seems incorrect. Because the software system is the system itself, not the data. So perhaps the example is wrong, but according to the schema, 'Software System' is the system or software. So in the sentence, 'The Tactical Control System data' is part"

So 'Intermediate files of cleaned-up ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry' is the software system? Or is it the data?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's parse the sentence.\n\nThe sentence is about the generation of intermediate files. The subject is the system (probably the software system). The files are generated in the event that cleaned-up telemetry is not provided by ESOC.\n\nSo, the entities to extract:\n\n- Software System: The system that generates the files.

So the software system is the system that creates these files, which is the ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry? Or is it the Tactical Control System? Wait, the input doesn't mention the Tactical Control System here. It's about ASPERA-3 and MEX OA.\n\nWait, perhaps the software system is the ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry.

So, External System is ['ASPERA-3', 'MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry'].\n\nSystem Requirements: The sentence mentions \"data availability\" and \"re-processing,\" which are what the system needs to do. So, System Requirements is ['data availability', 're-processing'].\n\nShared Phenomena: This is about shared events or states. The sentence includes \"telemetry\" and \"support the ASPERA-3 team.\" Telemetry is data being transmitted, and supporting the team is an action they share. So, Shared Phenomena is ['intermediate files', 'telemetry', 'data availability', 're-processing', 'support the ASPERA-3 team'].\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through each category again.\n\n- Software System: Only the ASPERA-3 team fits here.\n- Physical Device: Only the SwRI archive.\n- Environment Object: Intermediate files and cleaned-up telemetry.\n- External System: ASPERA-3 and MEX OA.\n- System Requirements: Data availability and re-processing.\n- Shared Phenomena: All the other elements like files, telemetry, etc.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key has the correct list of entities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"the ASPERA-3 team\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [\"a local SwRI archive\"],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"ASPERA-3\", \"MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"],\n  \"External System\": [\"ASPERA-3\", \"MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"data availability\", \"re-processing\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"intermediate files\", \"telemetry\", \"data availability\", \"re-processing\", \"support the ASPERA-3 team\"]\n}\n```"

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. The schema includes categories like Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input sentence carefully: \"Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data shall be provided for public view to monitor instrument performance.\" \n\nLet me break it down. The sentence is about providing web-based displays for ASPERA-3 data. So, I need to identify what each part refers to.\n\nStarting with 'Software System'. The sentence mentions \"Web-based displays\". That sounds like a software system because it's a web application that displays data. So, 'Web-based displays' should be under Software System.\n\nNext, 'Physical Device'. The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices like sensors or hardware. It's more about the data being displayed. So, Physical Device should be empty.\n\nMoving on to 'Environment Object'. The sentence talks about ASPERA-3 data and instrument performance. ASPERA-3 data is data, which is an entity in the real world. Instrument performance refers to the performance of instruments, which are real-world entities. So, both 'ASPERA-3 data' and 'instrument performance' fall under Environment Object.\n\n'External System' isn't mentioned here. The sentence doesn't refer to any external systems like databases or other services. So, External System remains empty.\n\n'System Requirements' are the purposes the system is supposed to fulfill. The sentence says \"shall be provided for public view to monitor instrument performance.\" This seems to be a requirement of the system. So, the requirement is about providing these displays. Therefore, 'Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data' is the System Requirement.\n\nLastly, 'Shared Phenomena' refers to shared events or states. The sentence mentions monitoring instrument performance, which is a shared phenomenon between the system and the instruments. So, 'monitor instrument performance' is the Shared Phenomena.\n\nPutting it all together, the entities are:\n\n- Software System: Web-based displays\n- Environment Object: ASPERA-3 data, instrument performance\n- System Requirements: Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data\n- Shared Phenomena: monitor instrument performance\n\nI don't see any Physical Devices or External Systems mentioned, so those categories remain empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"Web-based displays\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"ASPERA-3 data\", \"instrument performance\"],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": [\"monitor instrument performance\"]\n}\n```"

Let me check.\n\nWait, in the first example, the answer had 'Software System' as ['Tactical Control System'], and 'Physical Device' as empty. So, the software system is the system, and the physical device is a real-world device.\n\nIn the test input, the sentence is about Web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team. So, the software system is 'Web-based displays'. The physical device is not mentioned, so it's empty. Environment Object: the data and the team. External System: not mentioned, so empty. System Requirements: the purpose is to support the team in meeting mission goals. So, the requirement is 'to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives'.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples:\n\nIn the first example, the answer had 'System Requirements' as ['process payload product data from Electro Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) payloads'].\n\nIn the second example, 'System Requirements' included several items.\n\nIn the third example, 'System Requirements' was empty.\n\nWait, in the third example, the input was about displaying which C4I systems are supported, and the answer had 'System Requirements' as empty.\n\nSo, perhaps when the sentence"

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions, so I need to map the entities from the sentence to these categories.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"The web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team to be used for science analysis shall be password protected until the ASPERA-3 data is made public to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: This refers to the system or software being developed. In the sentence, the ASPERA-3 team is mentioned, but it's a team, not a software system. The displays are web-based, which might be part of a software system, but the primary system here is the ASPERA-3 team's displays. Wait, no, the displays are defined by the ASPERA-3 team, so maybe the displays are part of the software system. Hmm, but the software system is usually a system, not the team. So perhaps the software system here is the web-based displays themselves. Or maybe the ASPERA-3 team is the system? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The sentence says the displays are defined by the team, so the displays are part of the system. So the software system would be the web-based displays. But in the examples, sometimes the software system is explicitly mentioned. Here, it's not explicitly stated, but the displays are part of the system. So I think the software system is the web-based displays.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: This is a real-world device used to send/receive data. The sentence mentions displays, which are physical devices, but it also mentions data. The data is stored, so maybe the data is an environment object. The displays themselves are physical devices. So I should list 'web-based displays' as Physical Device.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: This is an entity in the real world. The sentence mentions ASPERA-3 data and the ASPERA-3 team. Data is an environment object. The team is people, so they are environment objects as well. So 'ASPERA-3 data' and 'ASPERA-3 team' are environment objects.\n\n4. **External System**: This is a manually designed domain that stores data. The sentence mentions 'password protected' and 'data is made public'. These seem like states rather than systems. Maybe 'password protected' is a characteristic, not a system. So perhaps there's no external system here.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: This is the aim of the system. The sentence mentions supporting mission goals and objectives. That sounds like a system requirement. So 'support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives' is a system requirement.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: This is a set of shared events. The sentence mentions the data being made public to support the team. The support is a shared phenomenon because it's a result of the data being public. So 'support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives' is shared phenomena.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the answer had 'support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives' as Shared Phenomena. So that aligns with my thought.\n\nNow, let me list each category:\n\n- **Software System**: The web-based displays are part of the software system, so 'The web-based displays' is the software system. But in the example, the answer had 'The ASPERA-3 team' as Software System. Wait, no, in the example, the answer was:\n\n{'Software System': ['The ASPERA-3 team'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the ASPERA-3 data'], 'External System': ['password protected'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives']}\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the team is a group, not a software system. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the input was about the ASPERA-3 displays being password protected, and the answer had Software System as ['The ASPERA-3 team'], which seems incorrect. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe example input was: \"The web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team"

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. The schema includes six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input sentence carefully: \"Science analysis software developed by SwRI to analyze IDFS-formatted data shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\"\n\nLet me break it down. The sentence mentions several entities. \n\nStarting with \"Science analysis software\" – that sounds like a Software System. So I'll add that to the Software System list.\n\nNext, \"developed by SwRI\" – SwRI is an organization, so that's probably an External System. So I'll add SwRI to External System.\n\nThen, \"to analyze IDFS-formatted data\" – IDFS-formatted data is a type of data, but looking at the schema, System Requirements are the aims and purposes of the system. Here, the software is meant to analyze this data, so maybe \"IDFS-formatted data\" is a Shared Phenomena since it's a set of data that the system interacts with. Alternatively, it could be part of the System Requirements. Hmm, but System Requirements are more about what the system should do, like \"shall be capable of importing\" or \"shall process data.\" In this case, the software is designed to analyze this data, so perhaps it's a Shared Phenomena because it's the data being shared or processed by the system.\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, in the first example, \"data receipt, data processing\" were both in Shared Phenomena. So maybe \"IDFS-formatted data\" is a Shared Phenomena.\n\nMoving on, \"shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" – ASPERA-3 Co-I’s are users or entities that will use the software. So they are Environment Objects because they are real-world entities interacting with the system.\n\nThen, \"to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting mission goals and objectives.\" The ASPERA-3 team is another group, so they are also Environment Objects.\n\nNow, checking the other categories: Physical Device – I don't see any mention of devices like sensors or hardware, so that's probably empty. External System includes SwRI, which is an organization. System Requirements – the sentence doesn't specify what the system must do beyond its function, so maybe it's empty here. Shared Phenomena includes the data being analyzed, so that's \"IDFS-formatted data.\"\n\nWait, but in the example where \"process payload product data\" was in Shared Phenomena, that was a data type. So yes, \"IDFS-formatted data\" fits there.\n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nSoftware System: ['Science analysis software']\nPhysical Device: []\nEnvironment Object: ['ASPERA-3 Co-I’s', 'ASPERA-3 team']\nExternal System: ['SwRI']\nSystem Requirements: []\nShared Phenomena: ['IDFS-formatted data']\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The sentence doesn't mention any devices, so Physical Device is empty. The software is the main system, SwRI is the developer, so External System. The Co-I’s and team are environment objects. The data being analyzed is shared phenomena.

Therefore, all entities are returned as empty lists.\n```\n\n## Task\nGiven the input sentence, extract all entities that match the schema definition. Return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\n\n## Approach\n1. **Identify the task**: Extract entities from the given sentence based on the provided schema.\n2. **Understand the schema**: The schema defines six entity types, each with specific characteristics.\n3. **Analyze the input sentence**: Look for keywords or phrases that match the entity types.\n4. **Extract entities**: For each entity type, check if the sentence contains any instances that fit.\n5. **Return the result**: Format the extracted entities into a JSON string as specified.\n\n## Steps to Extract Entities\n1. **Software System**: Look for terms like \"system\", \"software\", \"application\", etc.\n2. **Physical Device**: Look for terms like \"device\", \"machine\", \"sensor\", etc.\n3. **Environment Object**: Look for terms like \"object\", \"entity\", \"thing\", etc., that are part of the real world.\n4. **External System**: Look for terms like \"database\", \"external system\", \"third-party system\", etc.\n5. **System Requirements**: Look for terms like \"requirement\", \"must-have\", \"need\", etc.\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: Look for terms like \"event\", \"state\", \"value\", \"phenomenon\", etc., that are shared between entities.\n\n## How to Implement\n- **Tokenization**: Split the sentence into tokens (words and phrases).\n- **Pattern Matching**: For each token, check if it matches any of the entity types.\n- **Contextual Check**: Ensure that the matched token fits the definition of the entity type.\n- **Avoid Overmatching**: Ensure that terms are not classified into the wrong entity type due to partial matches.\n\n## Edge Cases\n- **No matching entities**: Return all entity types as empty lists.\n- **Ambiguous terms**: Terms that could fit multiple entity types should be classified based on the most specific match.\n- **Pluralization**: Handle plural forms by checking singular and plural forms of entity types.\n\n## Tools\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use NLP tools or libraries to assist in tokenization and pattern matching.\n- **Regex Matching**: Utilize regular expressions to identify potential matches for each entity type.\n\n## Example Walkthrough\nGiven the input sentence: \"The mnemonic, PR, is used in the requirement identifier to show that this requirement is a Privacy Requirement.\"\n1. **Tokenization**: Split into tokens: \"The\", \"mnemonic\", \"PR\", \"is\", \"used\", \"in\", \"the\", \"requirement\", \"identifier\", \"to\", \"show\", \"that\", \"this\", \"requirement\", \"is\", \"a\", \"Privacy\", \"Requirement.\"\n2. **Pattern Matching**:\n   - \"mnemonic\": Doesn't fit any entity type.\n   - \"PR\": Could be an abbreviation, but doesn't fit any entity type.\n   - \"requirement\": Fits \"System Requirements\".\n   - \"Privacy\": Fits \"Shared Phenomena\" as it refers to a shared state.\n3. **Contextual Check**: Ensure that \"requirement\" is indeed a system requirement and \"Privacy\" is a shared phenomenon.\n4. **Result**: Extract \"System Requirements\" and \"Shared Phenomena\".\n\n## Final Output\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['requirement'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['Privacy']}\n```\n\nBut wait, in the example provided earlier, the output was an empty list for all entities. So perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nLet me re-examine the task. The user provided an example where the input was about a requirement identifier using 'PR' for Privacy, and the output was all empty lists. So why was that?\n\nLooking back, the schema defines 'Shared Phenomena' as a set of shared events, states, and values. 'Privacy' is a state, so it should be under 'Shared Phenomena'. But in the example, the output was empty. Hmm, maybe because 'Privacy' is not explicitly mentioned as a phenomenon but rather as a requirement.\n\nWait, the example's expected output was all empty lists.

But according to the schema, 'Physical Device' is a real-world device that can send/receive data. 'Computer software' is not a physical device. So why is it included?\n\nHmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the schema.\n\nWait, looking back at the schema:\n\n'Physical Device' is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information.\n\nSo 'computer hardware' is a physical device. 'Computer software' is not a physical device. 'Computer communication' could be a type of service or system, but perhaps in this context, it's considered a physical device if it's part of the hardware.\n\nWait, but in the example, the answer includes 'computer software' in 'Physical Device', which seems incorrect based on the schema. So perhaps the example is wrong, or perhaps I'm misapplying the schema.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'computer communication' is considered a physical device if it's part of the hardware, like a network card or something. But 'computer software' is definitely not a physical device.\n\nSo perhaps the example is wrong, and the correct answer should exclude 'computer software' from 'Physical Device'.\n\nBut according to the example, it's included. So maybe the schema is being applied differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to extract entities based on the schema, regardless of whether they fit strictly or not, but according to the examples, sometimes non-physical devices are included.\n\nWait, looking at the first example:\n\nInput: The Tactical Control System hardware will permit long range communications from one to another, data storage expansion, access to other computers to share in processing capability, and multiple external peripherals.\n\nAnswer: 'Physical Device' includes 'computers' and 'peripherals'. But 'computers' are physical devices, while 'peripherals' are as well. So that makes sense.\n\nIn the test case, 'computer hardware' is a physical device, 'computer software' is not, and 'computer communication' is a bit ambiguous. It could be a service or a hardware component.\n\nBut according to the schema, 'Physical Device' is a real-world device. So 'computer communication' might not be a physical device but a service. So perhaps the example is wrong, and the correct answer should not include 'computer software' in 'Physical Device'.\n\nBut the example shows that it does. So perhaps the task is to extract any entity that matches the schema's type, regardless of whether it's a physical device or not, but based on the text.\n\nWait, no. The schema defines the types, and the task is to extract entities that match each type.\n\nSo 'Physical Device' should only include entities that are physical devices, i.e., real-world objects that can send/receive data.\n\nSo in the test case, 'computer hardware' is a physical device, 'computer software' is not, and 'computer communication' is a service, so it's not a physical device.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should have 'Physical Device' as ['computer hardware'], and exclude 'computer software' and 'computer communication'.\n\nBut the example shows all three are included. So perhaps the example is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'computer communication' is considered a physical device if it's part of the hardware, like a network interface card.\n\nBut 'computer software' is definitely not a physical device.\n\nSo perhaps the example is incorrect, and the correct answer should only include 'computer hardware' in 'Physical Device'.\n\nBut since the example includes all three, perhaps I should follow the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to extract any entity that is a 'Physical Device' as per the schema, regardless of whether it's a computer part or not.\n\nWait, the schema says 'Physical Device' is a device in the real world that can get/send/receive data. So 'computer hardware' is a physical device. 'Computer software' is not. 'Computer communication' could be a service or a hardware component. If it's a hardware component, it's a physical device. If it's a service, it's not.\n\nBut in the test case, it's not specified whether 'computer communication' is a hardware component or a service. So perhaps it's safer to include it as a physical device.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example includes all three, so perhaps the task is to include any entity that is a 'Physical Device' as per the schema, regardless of whether it's a computer part or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to extract any entity that is a 'Physical Device' based on the text, without considering whether it's a computer part"

So in the output, 'Environment Object' should be empty. But in the sample answer, it's including both as Environment Objects.

'Physical Device' is empty. 'Environment Object' is empty. 'External System' is empty. 'System Requirements' is empty. 'Shared Phenomena' is empty.\n\nBut the sample answer provided is wrong. So the correct output should be:\n\n{'Software System': ['There shall be a UNIX-based APAF system production computer with an archival system', 'UNIX-based APAF system production computer', 'archival system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nBut the sample answer given is:\n\n{'Software System': ['There shall be a UNIX-based APAF system production computer with an archival system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['a UNIX-based APAF system production computer', 'an archival system'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nWhich is incorrect because 'Environment Object' is being populated with software systems, which they shouldn't be. So the correct answer is the one I described.\n}\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to extract entities from a given sentence according to a specific schema. The schema defines six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each category has specific definitions, so I need to carefully analyze the input sentence to identify which entities fall into each category.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input sentence: \"There shall be a UNIX-based APAF system production computer with an archival system.\" My goal is to extract all entities that match the schema definitions.\n\nStarting with the **Software System** category. The definition states that a Software System is the system or software to be developed. In the sentence, \"UNIX-based APAF system production computer\" and \"archival system\" are both software systems. The entire phrase \"There shall be a UNIX-based APAF system production computer with an archival system\" also refers to the software system, so that should be included as well. Therefore, the Software System list will have three entries.\n\nNext, **Physical Device**. This category refers to real-world devices used for data transmission or processing. The sentence mentions a production computer and an archival system. However, the production computer is a software system, not a physical device. The archival system is also software, so there are no physical devices here. Thus, the Physical Device list remains empty.\n\nMoving on to **Environment Object**. This category includes real-world entities like patients, sun, etc. The sentence doesn't mention any such entities. The production computer and archival system are software, not real-world objects. Therefore, the Environment Object list is empty.\n\n**External System** refers to manually designed domains that store data, like databases or cards. The sentence doesn't mention any external systems, so this category is also empty.\n\n**System Requirements** are the aims of the system. The sentence describes the system's components but doesn't specify any requirements like data rates or functionalities. Hence, this list is empty.\n\nLastly, **Shared Phenomena** involves shared events or states between entities. The sentence doesn't discuss any shared phenomena, so this category is also empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct extraction should list all three software systems under Software System, leaving the other categories empty. The initial sample answer incorrectly included the production computer and archival system as Environment Objects, which they shouldn't be. Therefore, the correct JSON output should reflect only the Software System entries without any Environment Objects.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\n    \"There shall be a UNIX-based APAF system production computer with an archival system\",\n    \"UNIX-based APAF system production computer\",\n    \"archival system\"\n  ],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [],\n  \"System Requirements\": [],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```"

    "predict": " {'Software System': ['APAF system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['a web server'], 'System Requirements': ['web-based displays and information change'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to extract entities from the given sentence. The task is to identify all entities that match the defined schema. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions, so I need to apply those to the input.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"There shall be a web server for the APAF system for web-based displays and information change.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: The definition says it's the system or software being developed. In the sentence, \"APAF system\" seems to fit this category. So, APAF system is a Software System.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: This is a real-world device used to send/receive data. The sentence mentions \"a web server.\" However, a web server is more of a software component running on a physical device, like a computer. But according to the schema, Physical Device refers to the device itself, not the software. So, the physical device here would be the computer hosting the web server, but the sentence doesn't specify that. Therefore, I think there's no explicit Physical Device mentioned.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: This is an entity in the real world, like a person, place, or thing. The sentence doesn't mention any specific environment objects, like users or physical locations. So, this category remains empty.\n\n4. **External System**: This is a manually designed domain that stores data messages. The sentence refers to \"web-based displays and information change.\" These are functionalities, not external systems. The only external system mentioned is \"a web server,\" but that's more of a software component. So, I don't think there's an external system here.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: This is the aim of the system. The sentence states the purpose: web-based displays and information change. So, this fits under System Requirements.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: This is shared events or states between entities. The sentence doesn't mention any shared phenomena, like data being transferred or events happening between systems. So, this category is empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the entities I identified are:\n- Software System: APAF system\n- System Requirements: web-based displays and information change\n\nThe other categories don't have matching entities based on the sentence provided.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': ['APAF system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['web-based displays and information change'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}"

Let me start by understanding the task and the schema.\n\nThe task is to extract entities from a software requirements specification sentence. The entities to look for are: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each of these has specific definitions, so I need to make sure I correctly identify them.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the schema definitions again to make sure I understand each entity type.\n\n- **Software System**: This is the system or software being developed. Examples include 'The Tactical Control System software' or 'the web server application'.\n- **Physical Device**: A real-world device used for data transmission, like a computer or a server.\n- **Environment Object**: An entity in the real world, such as a patient, sun, or old. It's more about the setting or context.\n- **External System**: A manually designed domain that stores data messages, like a database or a tap.\n- **System Requirements**: The aim or purpose of the system, like 'hosted on a variety of operating systems'.\n- **Shared Phenomena**: Events, states, or values shared between connected entities, like 'map images'.\n\nNow, looking at the input sentence: \"SwRI shall provide software support for the APAF system.\"\n\nI need to parse this sentence and identify which entities are present.\n\nStarting with **Software System**: The sentence mentions \"software support\" and \"APAF system.\" The software support refers to the software system, so 'SwRI' is the software system. Also, 'APAF system' is another software system, but in the examples, sometimes the same entity is listed twice if it's mentioned multiple times. Wait, in the first example, 'The Tactical Control System software' and 'The Tactical Control System' are both included. So here, 'SwRI' is the software system, and 'APAF system' is another software system. So both should be included.\n\nNext, **Physical Device**: The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices like computers or servers. So this should be an empty list.\n\n**Environment Object**: The sentence doesn't talk about any environment objects like patients or the sun. So this is empty.\n\n**External System**: 'APAF system' is an external system because it's a manually designed domain that stores data messages. So 'APAF system' is an external system.\n\n**System Requirements**: The sentence says \"provide software support,\" which is a requirement. So 'software support' is the system requirement.\n\n**Shared Phenomena**: The sentence doesn't mention any shared events or states, so this is empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the extracted entities are:\n\n- Software System: ['SwRI', 'APAF system']\n- Physical Device: []\n- Environment Object: []\n- External System: ['APAF system']\n- System Requirements: ['software support']\n- Shared Phenomena: []\n\nWait, but in the examples, sometimes the same entity is listed twice if it's mentioned in different ways. For example, in the first example, 'The Tactical Control System software' and 'The Tactical Control System' are both included. So in this case, 'SwRI' is the software system, and 'APAF system' is another software system. So both should be included in the Software System list.\n\nI think that's correct. So the final JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": ['SwRI', 'APAF system'],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": ['APAF system'],\n  \"System Requirements\": ['software support'],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```"

    "predict": " {'Software System': [], 'Physical System': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nWait, but in the schema, the categories are 'Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena'. So in the test input, the user wrote 'Physical System' instead of 'Physical Device'. So the correct answer is to ignore 'Physical System' and treat it as non-existent, so the output is all empty lists.\n\nSo, the task is to extract entities from the input sentence, matching the schema categories. If an entity doesn't match any of the schema categories, it's ignored. So, for each word in the sentence, we need to determine if it's an instance of any of the schema categories.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Split the input sentence into tokens (words and punctuation).\n2. For each token, determine if it matches any of the schema categories.\n3. Collect all the tokens that match each category.\n4. Return a JSON object where each key is a schema category, and the value is a list of the matched tokens.\n\nBut how to determine if a token matches a schema category?\n\nLooking at the schema:\n\n- Software System: a system or software. So, words like 'Software', 'System', 'Application', 'Solution', etc.\n- Physical Device: a device in the real world that can send/receive data. So, words like 'Device', 'Sensor', 'Controller', 'Printer', 'Smartphone', etc.\n- Environment Object: an entity in the real world. So, words like 'Patient', 'Sun', 'Old', 'Tree', etc.\n- External System: a manually designed domain that can store data messages. So, words like 'Database', 'Magnetic Stripe Card', 'Tap', 'Hard Disk', etc.\n- System Requirements: the aim and purpose of the system. So, words like 'Requirement', 'Need', 'Goal', 'Objective', etc.\n- Shared Phenomena: a set of shared events. So, words like 'Event', 'State', 'Value', 'Phenomenon', etc.\n\nSo, the plan is to:\n\n- For each token, check if it matches any of the schema categories based on the above definitions.\n\nBut how to implement this? Since the user is to write code, perhaps using regular expressions or some kind of lookup.\n\nBut since the user is to write code, perhaps the code can have a dictionary mapping each schema category to a list of possible words that match it.\n\nFor example:\n\nschema = {\n    'Software System': ['Software', 'System', 'Application', 'Solution', 'Platform', 'Tool', 'Environment', 'Component', 'Module', 'Library', 'Framework'],\n    'Physical Device': ['Device', 'Sensor', 'Controller', 'Printer', 'Smartphone', 'Tablet', 'Computer', 'Display', 'Speaker', 'Camera', 'Wearable', 'Robot'],\n    'Environment Object': ['Patient', 'Sun', 'Old', 'Tree', 'Mountain', 'Water', 'Road', 'Building', 'Vehicle', 'Pedestrian', 'Animal', 'Plant'],\n    'External System': ['Database', 'Magnetic Stripe Card', 'Tap', 'Hard Disk', 'Smart Card', 'Chip', 'Server', 'Cloud', 'Storage', 'Network', 'Communication Channel'],\n    'System Requirements': ['Requirement', 'Need', 'Goal', 'Objective', 'Constraint', 'Specification', 'Condition', 'Criterion', 'Target', 'Standard', 'Performance', 'Usability'],\n    'Shared Phenomena': ['Event', 'State', 'Value', 'Phenomenon', 'Measurement', 'Data', 'Information', 'Signal', 'Message', 'Transaction', 'Update', 'Notification', 'Alert', 'Status', 'Condition', 'Result', 'Output', 'Log', 'Trace', 'Record']\n}\n\nBut this is a simplified approach. The actual code may need to be more precise, perhaps using regular expressions or context-aware matching.\n\nBut for the purpose of this task, perhaps using a dictionary of possible words for each category is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code can:\n\n- Split the input into tokens, considering words and possibly ignoring punctuation.\n- For each token, check if it exists in any of the schema's word lists.\n- If it does, add it to the corresponding category's list.\n\nBut wait, the test case had 'Physical System' which is not in the schema, so it's ignored. So, the code should only consider the exact schema categories.\n\nSo, the code can:\n\n- For each token, check if it is a key in the schema's word lists. If it is, add it to the corresponding category.\n\nBut in the test case, the token was 'Physical System', which is not a key in any of the schema's word lists, so it's ignored"

But the example shows it as non-empty. So, perhaps the example is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the schema. Let me re-examine the schema.\n\nThe schema defines:\n\n- Software System: the system or software.\n- Physical Device: a device in the real world that can send/receive data.\n- Environment Object: an entity in the real world, like patient, sun, old.\n- External System: a manually designed domain that can store data messages, like database, magnetic stripe, etc.\n- System Requirements: the aim and purpose of the system.\n- Shared Phenomena: shared events, states, values between connected entities.\n\nSo, in the input sentence: \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data and any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry shall be provided to all ASPERA-3 Co-I's.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- ASPERA-3: this is a software system, so it should be in 'Software System'.\n- MEX OA IDFS data: this is data, not a physical device or environment object. So, perhaps it's part of the 'Shared Phenomena' or 'System Requirements'?\n- any APAF-generated intermediate files: similar to above, data, so perhaps 'Shared Phenomena'.\n- cleaned-up telemetry: data, same as above.\n\nSo, the entities to extract:\n\n- Software System: ASPERA-3 Co-I's (since it's plural, but the singular is ASPERA-3)\n- Environment Object: None, because ASPERA-3 is a software system, MEX OA is an external system? Wait, MEX OA is an external system? Or is it part of the software?\n\nWait, MEX OA IDFS data: MEX OA is an external system, as per the schema. Because External System is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. So, MEX OA is an external system, and the data it generates is part of its functionality.\n\nSo, in the input, MEX OA is an External System, and the data it generates is part of the Shared Phenomena.\n\nSo, in the input sentence, the entities are:\n\n- Software System: ASPERA-3 Co-I's\n- External System: MEX OA\n- Environment Object: None\n- Shared Phenomena: MEX OA IDFS data, any APAF-generated intermediate files, cleaned-up telemetry\n\nSo, the correct extraction should be:\n\nSoftware System: ['ASPER"

The task is to identify all entities that match the defined schema. Let me start by understanding the schema and the input sentence.\n\nThe schema has six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena. Each has specific definitions.\n\nThe input sentence is: \"MEX OA IDFS data that are electronically distributed shall be provided to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s within 24 hours of acquiring MEX OA telemetry as long as the transmission and processing are error-free to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence into parts to identify potential entities.\n\n1. **Software System**: This refers to the system being developed. In the sentence, the software systems mentioned are \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" and \"MEX OA IDFS data\" might be part of a system, but I'm not sure. Wait, MEX OA IDFS data is more like data, not a system. ASPERA-3 Co-I’s are part of an external system, so maybe not here.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: This is a real-world device. The sentence mentions \"telemetry\" which is data from a device. So \"telemetry\" is a Physical Device. Also, \"MEX OA IDFS data\" might be data from a device, but I'm not certain. Wait, IDFS data is data, not a device. So maybe only \"telemetry\" is a Physical Device.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: This is an entity in the real world. The sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" and \"MEX OA\" as environment objects. \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" are people or systems in the environment. \"MEX OA\" is likely an environment object, like a mission or system.\n\n4. **External System**: These are manually designed domains. \"ASPERA-3 team\" is part of an external system, so \"ASPERA-3 team\" is an External System. Also, \"MEX OA\" might be part of an external system, but I'm not sure. Wait, MEX OA is more like an environment object or part of a system.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: These are the aims of the system. The sentence mentions \"to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives.\" So the System Requirements would be the support for the team and meeting mission goals.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: These are shared events or data. The sentence mentions \"telemetry,\" \"transmission and processing,\" and \"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives.\" These are all shared phenomena.\n\nNow, let me go through each category step by step.\n\n- **Software System**: The sentence doesn't mention any software systems directly. The ASPERA-3 Co-I’s might be part of an external system, not a software system. So this category is empty.\n\n- **Physical Device**: \"telemetry\" is data from a device, so that's a Physical Device. \"MEX OA IDFS data\" is data, not a device, so only \"telemetry\" is here.\n\n- **Environment Object**: \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" are people or part of the environment. \"MEX OA\" is an environment object, like a system or mission. So both are Environment Objects.\n\n- **External System**: \"ASPERA-3 team\" is an external system. \"MEX OA\" might be part of an external system, but I think it's more of an environment object. So only \"ASPERA-3 team\" is here.\n\n- **System Requirements**: The support for the team and meeting mission goals are the system requirements.\n\n- **Shared Phenomena**: The shared data and events are telemetry, transmission and processing, and meeting mission goals.\n\nPutting it all together, the entities should be:\n\n- Physical Device: ['telemetry']\n- Environment Object: ['ASPERA-3 Co-I’s', 'MEX OA']\n- External System: ['ASPERA-3 team']\n- System Requirements: ['support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives']\n- Shared Phenomena: ['telemetry', 'transmission and processing', 'meeting MEX mission goals and objectives']\n\nWait, but in the example given, the answer had 'MEX OA IDFS data' and 'telemetry"

Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nThe sentence is: \"Any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry that are electronically distributed shall be provided to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s within 24 hours of acquiring ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry as long as the transmission and processing are error-free to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence into parts to identify each entity type.\n\n1. **Software System**: Looking for systems or software. The sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" and \"ASPERA-3\" and \"MEX OA\". Wait, but \"ASPERA-3\" and \"MEX OA\" are probably external systems or environment objects. \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" might be part of the software system. Hmm, but the schema defines 'Software System' as the system or software. So, \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" could be a software system, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe \"ASPERA-3\" is an external system. I need to clarify.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: These are real-world devices. The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices like hardware, so I think this category is empty.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: These are real-world entities. The sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3\" and \"MEX OA\" as mission components, so they are environment objects. Also, \"telemetry\" is data, which might fall under environment object as per the examples. Wait, in the examples, \"telemetry data\" was under 'Shared Phenomena'. So maybe \"telemetry\" is a shared phenomenon. But \"cleaned-up telemetry\" is a type of data, so perhaps it's an environment object. Or maybe not. I need to be careful.\n\n4. **External System**: These are manually designed domains that store data. The sentence talks about \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry that are electronically distributed\". So \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\" and \"telemetry that are electronically distributed\" could be external systems. Also, \"telemetry that are electronically distributed\" might be an external system because it's a data storage method.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: These are the aims of the system. The sentence mentions \"provided to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s within 24 hours... to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives.\" So the requirement is about providing data on time to meet mission goals. So the requirement is the entire part after \"shall be provided\" until the end.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: These are shared events or data. The sentence mentions \"telemetry\" and \"tactical communication messages\" in other examples, so \"telemetry\" here is likely a shared phenomenon. Also, \"cleaned-up telemetry\" and \"telemetry that are electronically distributed\" might be shared phenomena as well.\n\nWait, but in the examples, \"telemetry data\" was under 'Shared Phenomena'. So in this case, \"telemetry\" and \"cleaned-up telemetry\" should be under that category.\n\nNow, let's list each entity:\n\n- **Software System**: The only possible candidate is \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\". But I'm not sure if that's a software system or part of an external system. Alternatively, \"ASPERA-3\" might be an external system. Maybe \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" is part of the software system. But looking at the examples, in the first input, \"Tactical Control System\" was the software system. So perhaps \"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\" is the software system here.\n\n- **Environment Object**: \"ASPERA-3\", \"MEX OA\", and \"telemetry\". Wait, but \"telemetry\" is data, which might be a shared phenomenon. So perhaps only \"ASPERA-3\" and \"MEX OA\" are environment objects.\n\n- **External System**: \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up"

Or is \"NASA PDS\" considered a software system? Hmm, according to the schema, Software System is the system or software being developed. Since NASA PDS is an external system that receives data, it's more likely an External System. So, no Software System in this case.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: This is a real-world device used to send or receive data. The sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3 IDFS data\" and \"MEX OA IDFS data.\" These are data types, not physical devices. The only physical device I can think of is if \"IDFS\" stands for something like a file format or a device, but I'm not sure. Wait, IDFS might be a file format, so the data is stored on devices, but the devices themselves aren't mentioned. The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices like hard drives or specific hardware. So probably, no Physical Devices here.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: These are real-world entities. The sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3 IDFS data\" and \"MEX OA IDFS data.\" These are data sets, not real-world objects. So they don't fit into Environment Objects. Unless IDFS is a type of object, but I think data is more about Shared Phenomena or External Systems.\n\n4. **External System**: This is a manually designed system that can store data. The sentence ends with \"NASA PDS,\" which is a system that receives data. So NASA PDS is an External System.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: These are the aims or purposes of the system. The sentence is about providing data to NASA PDS, but it doesn't specify any requirements of the system itself. So no System Requirements here.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: This refers to shared events or data. The sentence mentions data being provided, so the data itself is Shared Phenomena. So \"ASPERA-3 IDFS data\" and \"MEX OA IDFS data\" fall under Shared Phenomena.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the answer had Environment Object as the data. Let me check that example again. Oh, in one of the examples, data was considered an Environment Object. Wait, no, in the first example, \"NITF 2.0 imagery files\" were considered Environment Objects. But in another example, data was considered Shared Phenomena. Hmm, I need to clarify.\n\nLooking back at the schema: Environment Object is an entity in the real world, like patient, sun, etc. Data is more of a Shared Phenomena because it's information shared between entities. So in this case, the data (ASPERA-3 IDFS and MEX OA IDFS data) should be Shared Phenomena.\n\nBut wait, in the example where the answer was:\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['ASPERA-3 IDFS data', 'MEX OA IDFS data'], 'External System': ['NASA PDS'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nWait, no, in the test input, the answer had Environment Object as the data. But according to the schema, data is Shared Phenomena. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me check the test input and answer again. The test input was:\n\n\"ASPERA-3 IDFS data and MEX OA IDFS data shall be provided to NASA PDS.\"\n\nThe answer was:\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['ASPERA-3 IDFS data', 'MEX OA IDFS data'], 'External System': ['NASA PDS'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nBut according to the schema, Shared Phenomena is the data, so why are they in Environment Object"

    "predict": " {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['NASA PDS'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nWait, but in the example, the software system is \"ASPERA-3 data\" but according't that a data, not a software system? So, the software system is the system that provides the data, which is the Tactical Control System in the previous examples. So, in this case, the software system is the system that provides the data, which is not mentioned here. So, the software system is not present in the input.\n\nSo, the correct answer should have 'Software System' as empty list, 'External System' as ['NASA PDS'], and others as empty.\n\nBut in the given answer, 'Software System' is empty, 'External System' is ['NASA PDS'], others are empty. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the subject is \"ASPERA-3 data shall be provided to NASA PDS in PDS-compliant form.\" So, the software system is the system that is providing the data, which is not mentioned here. So, in this case, the software system is not present, so it's empty.\n\nSo, the correct answer is as given.\n\nBut let me think again. The sentence is about the data being provided to NASA PDS. So, the software system that is providing the data is not mentioned. So, in the schema, 'Software System' is the system or software. Since it's not mentioned, it's not present.\n\nSo, the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"The Tactical Control System shall receive, process, and present payload data to the operator so that the status of the payload can be determined.\" The software system is 'Tactical Control System', and the environment object is 'operator'. So, the answer correctly captures that.\n\nSo, in the test case, the software system is not mentioned, so it's empty. The external system is 'NASA PDS', which is an external system as per the definition.\n\nSo, the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['NASA PDS'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}"

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. The schema includes categories like Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena.\n\nFirst, let's look at the input sentence: \"ASPERA-3 data shall be calibrated and validated prior to depositing in the NASA PDS.\" \n\nI'll break it down word by word to see which entities fit into each category.\n\n1. **Software System**: The sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3 data.\" Wait, ASPERA-3 is a mission or dataset, not a software system. The software system would be something like a system that processes this data, but here it's the data itself. So I don't think there's a software system here.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: The sentence talks about data being processed, but there's no mention of physical devices like instruments or hardware. So this category is probably empty.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: This could be anything in the real world. The sentence mentions \"NASA PDS,\" which stands for the NASA Planetary Data System. That's an external system, not an environment object. So no environment objects here.\n\n4. **External System**: The sentence says \"depositing in the NASA PDS.\" NASA PDS is a system, specifically an external one as per the schema. So this should be added to External System.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence is about the process of calibrating and validating data before depositing. It doesn't specify any requirements for the system itself, so this category remains empty.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: The sentence doesn't mention any shared events or states between entities. It's more about the data and the system, not shared phenomena.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the only entity extracted is \"NASA PDS\" under External System. All other categories are empty.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['NASA PDS'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}"

The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. The schema includes six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena.\n\nLet me start by reading the input sentence carefully: \"ASPERA-3 data shall be provided to NASA PDS no later than 6 months after acquisition.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify potential entities. \n\nThe sentence mentions \"ASPERA-3 data.\" I need to determine which category this falls into. Looking at the schema, 'ASPERA-3 data' seems to be a piece of data, which is a type of information. But the categories don't have a specific 'Data' entity. However, 'Shared Phenomena' is defined as a set of shared events, states, and values between connected entities. Since data can be considered shared phenomena, I think this should go under 'Shared Phenomena.'\n\nNext, the sentence says \"to NASA PDS.\" 'NASA PDS' is likely an external system because it's a manually designed domain that stores data, like a database or a system that handles data. So, 'NASA PDS' should be categorized under 'External System.'\n\nNow, looking for 'Software System,' I don't see any software mentioned here. The sentence is more about data transfer rather than software development or operation. So, 'Software System' remains empty.\n\n'Physical Device' refers to real-world devices that send or receive data. The sentence doesn't mention any devices like sensors or hardware, so this category is empty.\n\n'Environment Object' is an entity in the real world. Here, 'ASPERA-3' is a mission or dataset, not an environment object. 'NASA PDS' is an external system, not an environment object. So, this category is empty.\n\n'System Requirements' are the aims of the system. The sentence doesn't specify any requirements for the system; it's more about data transfer. So, this category is empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the only entities identified are 'NASA PDS' under 'External System' and 'ASPERA-3 data' under 'Shared Phenomena.'\n\nI should double-check to ensure I didn't miss anything. The sentence doesn't mention any software, physical devices, or environment objects beyond what's already considered. Therefore, the final JSON should reflect these findings.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['NASA PDS'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['ASPERA-3 data']}"

    "predict": "{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [\"IRF\"], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\nWait, but in the test input, the sentence is \"SwRI shall provide IDFS data processing algorithms to IRF.\" So, according to the schema, we need to extract entities.\n\nLooking at the schema, the entities are:\n\n- Software System: the system or software. So, in this sentence, \"SwRI\" is a software system? Or is it an organization? Hmm, the examples show that \"Software System\" is the system or software being developed. So, in the first example, \"Tactical Control System\" is the software system. So, in this case, \"SwRI\" is likely a software system.\n\n- Physical Device: a device in the real world. In the sentence, there's no mention of any physical device, so it's empty.\n\n- Environment Object: an entity in the real world. \"IDFS data processing algorithms\" is a process, not an object. So, perhaps \"IDFS data processing algorithms\" is a System Requirement. Wait, but let's see.\n\nWait, the sentence is \"SwRI shall provide IDFS data processing algorithms to IRF.\" So, \"IDFS data processing algorithms\" is something that SwRI is providing. So, is that a System Requirement? Because System Requirements are the aim and purpose of the system. So, in the examples, when a system is supposed to process something, that something is under System Requirements.\n\nSo, \"IDFS data processing algorithms\" is a System Requirement. Then, \"IRF\" is an External System, because it's a manually designed domain that can store data messages. So, IRF is an external system.\n\nSo, in the test input, the entities would be:\n\n- Software System: ['SwRI'] because SwRI is the system providing the algorithms.\n\n- Physical Device: empty.\n\n- Environment Object: empty, because there are no real-world objects mentioned.\n\n- External System: ['IRF'].\n\n- System Requirements: ['IDFS data processing algorithms'].\n\n- Shared Phenomena: empty, because there's no shared events or states mentioned.\n\nSo, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\"Software System\": [\"SwRI\"], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [\"IRF\"], \"System Requirements\": [\"IDFS data processing algorithms\"], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\nBut in the given test input, the expected output is:\n\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [\"IRF\"], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my analysis. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, in the test input, the sentence is \"SwRI shall provide IDFS data processing algorithms to IRF.\" So, SwRI is providing something to IRF. So, SwRI is a software system, and IRF is an external system. The thing being provided is the data processing algorithms, which is a system requirement for SwRI.\n\nSo, in the schema, \"System Requirements\" refers to the aim and purpose of the system. So, the data processing algorithms are part of the system's requirements.\n\nSo, the entities should be:\n\n- Software System: SwRI.\n\n- External System: IRF.\n\n- System Requirements: IDFS data processing algorithms.\n\nSo, the JSON should have Software System as [\"SwRI\"], External System as [\"IRF\"], and System Requirements as [\"IDFS data processing algorithms\"].\n\nBut the expected output in the test case is different. It has Software System as empty, External System as empty, and System Requirements as [\"IRF\"].\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the roles. Let me look at the examples again.\n\nIn the first example, the sentence is about the Tactical Control System providing data to C4I systems. The answer includes 'Software System' as Tactical Control System, 'External System' as C4I systems, and 'Shared Phenomena' as the data.\n\nIn the second example, the Tactical Control System is processing data from various payloads. The answer includes 'Software System' as Tactical Control System, 'Environment Object' as the payloads, and 'System Requirements' as the processing function.\n\nIn the third example, the system contains a CD-ROM drive compatible with NIMA data. The answer includes 'Software System' as the system, 'Physical Device' as the CD-ROM drive, 'Environment Object' as NIMA, and 'External System' as the data on the CD-ROM.\n\nIn the fourth example, the system is importing data from NIMA and via compact disk. The answer includes 'Software System' as the system, 'Environment Object' as NIMA and compact disk, 'External System' as the data types, and 'System Requirements' as the capability to import.\n\nIn the fifth example, the HCI is designed according"

So, this category remains empty.\n\nLastly, 'Shared Phenomena': There are no shared events or states mentioned here.

The ground data system could be a physical device if it's hardware, but if it's software, then it's part of the software system.\n\nWait, perhaps the ground data system is a physical device.

So, perhaps the test case is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the software system is not mentioned, but the ground data system is part of the environment.\n\nWait, perhaps the ground data system is an external system.\n\nWait, the schema defines 'External System' as a manually designed domain that can store data messages, like a database, magnetic stripe card, etc.\n\nSo, if the ground data system is a database, then it's an external system.\n\nBut the input is about the APAF ground data system requirements. So, the software system is 'APAF ground data system', which is a software system.\n\nSo, the software system should be extracted.\n\nTherefore, the test case's answer is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the test case is correct because the software system is not mentioned, but the ground data"

So, Software System would include \"The APAF data system\".\n\nNext, \"data system\" - is this a Physical Device? No, because Physical Devices are real-world devices used to send/receive data. \"Data system\" is more of a software or external system.

So, for each entity type, if any of the entities in the sentence match, they are included.\n\nLooking at the sentence again:\n\n\"The APAF data system will not impose hazards to personnel, property, or the environment.\"\n\nSo, \"The APAF data system\" is a Software System.\n\n\"the environment\" is an Environment Object.\n\n\"hazards to personnel, property, or the environment\" are Shared Phenomena.\n\nSo, the JSON should include these.\n\nBut the user's test expects an empty list.

But in the sample input, it's mapped to 'Software System' correctly. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother test case: The system will interact with a database, which is an external system.\nAnswer: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['database'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nSo, the task is to extract all entities from the given sentence that match the schema.\n\nNow, the task is to process the input sentence and extract entities as per the schema.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the entities in the sentence. The entities to look for are:\n\n- Software System\n- Physical Device\n- Environment Object\n- External System\n- System Requirements\n- Shared Phenomena\n\nEach of these has specific definitions, so I need to parse the sentence and find all occurrences that match these definitions.\n\nLet me take the example given:\n\nInput: The Tactical Control System shall be designed such that no single software error results in an unsafe command to be transmitted to the air vehicle.\n\nAnswer: {'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': ['the air vehicle'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['an unsafe command'], 'System Requirements': ['designed such that no single software error results in an unsafe command to be transmitted to the air vehicle'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['no single software error results']}\n\nSo, in this case, 'The Tactical Control System' is a Software System. 'the air vehicle' is a Physical Device. 'an unsafe command' is an External System. The System Requirements is the entire clause, and Shared Phenomena is part of that clause.\n\nSo, the approach is to parse the sentence, identify all possible entities, and then map them to the correct categories.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all possible entities in the sentence. Let's break down the sentence:\n\n\"The Tactical Control System shall be designed such that no single software error results in an unsafe command to be transmitted to the air vehicle.\"\n\nPossible entities:\n\n- Software System: The Tactical Control System\n- Physical Device: air vehicle\n- External System: unsafe command\n- System Requirements: designed such that no single software error results in an unsafe command to be transmitted to the air vehicle\n- Shared Phenomena: no single software error results\n\nSo, each of these is identified as per the schema.\n\nNow, the challenge is to automate this process.\n\nI think the best way is to use a combination of keyword matching and context-aware extraction.\n\nFirst, identify all the keywords that match each entity type.\n\nFor Software System: Look for terms like \"system\", \"software\", \"application\", etc., followed by a proper noun or specific name.\n\nFor Physical Device: Look for terms like \"device\", \"controller\", \"sensor\", \"machine\", etc., which are physical and used to send/receive data.\n\nFor Environment Object: Look for terms that are objects in the real world, like \"patient\", \"sun\", \"home\", etc.\n\nFor External System: Look for terms that are systems or databases, like \"database\", \"system\", \"tap\", etc.\n\nFor System Requirements: Look for clauses that describe the purpose or aim of the system.\n\nFor Shared Phenomena: Look for events or states that are shared between entities, like \"error results\", \"command transmission\", etc.\n\nBut this approach might not be sufficient because context is important. For example, \"air vehicle\" is a physical device, but \"air vehicle simulator\" might be a software system or a physical device depending on context.\n\nWait, in the example given, \"air vehicle simulator\" is considered a Physical Device. So, perhaps the term \"simulator\" indicates it's a physical device in that context.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a software system if it's a simulation running on a computer.\n\nThis shows that context is crucial. So, perhaps a more context-aware approach is needed.\n\nAnother approach is to use NLP techniques like named entity recognition (NER) to identify entities and then classify them into the schema categories.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to think about how to identify each entity type.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify all possible entities in the sentence.\n\n2. For each entity, determine which schema category it belongs to.\n\n3. Collect all entities into the respective categories.\n\nSo, let's take the input sentence and process it step by step.\n\nGiven sentence: \"Therefore, there are no safety requirements of the APAF ground data system.\"\n\nFirst, identify the entities:\n\n- APAF ground data system: This is a specific system"

It's a bit ambiguous because the sentence is a bit complex.\n\nIn this case, 'APAF data system' is clearly a software system. 'associated software' is also a software system.\n\nSo, the answer is as given.\n\nAnother example: 'the operational software' and 'Training software' are both software systems.\n\nSo, the process is to identify each noun phrase that fits into the schema categories.\n\nIn this case, the sentence is:\n\nAlthough the APAF data system and associated software will be developed with the highest quality possible, there are no requirements concerned with software quality.\n\nSo, the entities are:\n\n- APAF data system: Software System\n- associated software: Software System\n- data: not a category\n- quality: not a category\n\nSo, the JSON is as given.\n\nAnother example: 'tactical UAVs' is a physical device.\n\nSo, the process is to identify each noun that fits into the categories.\n\nSo, the answer is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is to:\n\n- Use NLP techniques to extract entities.\n- For each extracted entity, determine which schema category it belongs to.\n- Collect them accordingly.\n\nBut since this is a manual process, perhaps the best way is to read the sentence and identify each noun or noun phrase that fits into the schema.\n\nIn this case, the sentence has two software systems: APAF data system and associated software.\n\nSo, the JSON is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'The Tactical Control System software' is a software system.\n\nSo, it's under 'Software System'.\n\nSo, the process is clear.\n\nSo, the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\n{'Software System': ['APAF data system', 'associated software'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}"

But according to the schema, 'Environment Object' is an entity in the real world, which is separate from the software system. So, perhaps the test input is incorrect, or maybe the software system and environment object can sometimes be the same? Or perhaps the test input is a trick, expecting the software system to be extracted, and the environment object not to be. But according to the schema, 'Environment Object' is a real-world entity, so if the software system is a software, it's not an environment object. So in the test input, 'APAF data system' is a software system, so it shouldn't be considered as an environment object. Therefore, the correct answer should have 'Software System' as ['APAF data system'], 'Environment Object' as empty, and 'Shared Phenomena' as empty.

    "predict": " {'Software System': ['APAF system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the APAF data system'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['provide installation and operations procedures of the APAF system in enough detail'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to extract entities from the given sentence. The task is to identify all entities that match the schema provided. The schema includes six categories: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, and Shared Phenomena.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input sentence carefully. The sentence is: \"In addition, the APAF Operations Procedures Document shall provide installation and operations procedures of the APAF system in enough detail where there are no training-related requirements for users and operators of the APAF data system.\"\n\nLet me break it down. The sentence is about the APAF system's documentation. It mentions the APAF Operations Procedures Document, which is likely a software system. Then, it talks about providing installation and operations procedures, which are part of the system's requirements. It also refers to the APAF data system, which might be an external system or an environment object.\n\nLooking at the schema:\n\n1. **Software System**: This would be the system itself. In the sentence, \"APAF system\" is mentioned, so that's a Software System. Also, \"APAF Operations Procedures Document\" could be considered part of the software system since it's a document related to the system.\n\n2. **Physical Device**: The sentence doesn't mention any physical devices, like hardware components. So this category should be empty.\n\n3. **Environment Object**: This refers to entities in the real world. The sentence mentions \"users and operators of the APAF data system.\" The data system itself is an external system, but the users and operators are people, so they might fall under Environment Object. However, in the examples provided, when a system's users are mentioned, they are sometimes categorized under Environment Object. For example, in one of the test cases, \"the operator\" was an Environment Object. So here, \"users and operators\" could be considered Environment Objects.\n\n4. **External System**: The sentence refers to the \"APAF data system.\" Since it's a separate system, it's likely an External System. It's a domain or a database that interacts with the main system.\n\n5. **System Requirements**: The sentence mentions that the document provides \"installation and operations procedures... in enough detail.\" This seems to describe what the system should do, so it's a System Requirement.\n\n6. **Shared Phenomena**: The sentence doesn't mention any shared events or states between entities. So this category remains empty.\n\nNow, I'll map these findings into the JSON structure. Each key corresponds to the schema category, and the value is a list of entities matching that category.\n\n- Software System: ['APAF system', 'APAF Operations Procedures Document']\n- Physical Device: []\n- Environment Object: ['users and operators']\n- External System: ['APAF data system']\n- System Requirements: ['provide installation and operations procedures of the APAF system in enough detail']\n- Shared Phenomena: []\n\nWait, but in the test case provided earlier, the answer included 'APAF data system' as an External System. So I think that's correct here as well.\n\nI should also check if any other entities are present. The sentence doesn't mention any other systems or devices, so I think the categories are covered.\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect these entities accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"APAF system\", \"APAF Operations Procedures Document\"],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [\"users and operators\"],\n  \"External System\": [\"APAF data system\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [\"provide installation and operations procedures of the APAF system in enough detail\"],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```"
