The entities are extracted based on the schema definition provided. Physical devices and environment objects are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, so they are left out. The software system is not directly mentioned, but the context implies that the ASPERA-3 and MEX OA systems are part of a larger software system. The system requirements are clearly stated in the sentence, and the shared phenomena include the types of data and the conditions under which they are provided. ## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in understanding CPSs requirements and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification, extract all entities that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent entity types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Software System', 'Physical Device', 'Environment Object', 'External System', 'System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']\n'Software System': is the system or software.\n'Physical Device': is a device in the real world, which can be used to get/send/receive data/information. \n'Environment Object': is an entity in the real world. Here are some examples: the patient, the sun, the old.\n'External System': is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. Here are some examples: a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk.\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. \n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\n## Examples\nInput:The NITF 2.0 imagery files generated by the Tactical Control System shall contain the necessary telemetry and support data to permit subsequent imagery exploitation by C4I systems.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['NITF 2.0 imagery files'], 'External System': ['C4I systems'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['telemetry and support data']}\nInput:RS170A video and digital imagery shall be routed to Tactical Control System functions and displayed upon operator request.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['Tactical Control System functions'], 'Physical Device': ['RS170A video'], 'Environment Object': ['digital imagery', 'operator request'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:AV telemetry data shall be available to support other Tactical Control System functions as required.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': ['AV'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['support other Tactical Control System functions as required'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['telemetry data']}\nInput:Payload telemetry data shall be available to support other Tactical Control System functions as required.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['Payload telemetry data']}\n\n## Test\nInput:Any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry that are electronically distributed shall be provided to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s within 24 hours of acquiring ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry as long as the transmission and processing are error-free to support the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives.\nAnswer: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['APAF-generated intermediate files', 'ASPERA-3 Co-I’s'], 'System Requirements': ['provided to the ASPERA-3 team in meeting MEX mission goals and objectives'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['cleaned-up telemetry', 'electronic distributed', 'acquiring ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry', 'transmission and processing are error-free']}\n## Rationale\nThe input sentence contains references to external systems, system requirements, and shared phenomena. The entities are extracted based on the schema definition provided. Physical devices and environment objects are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, so they are left out. The software system is not directly mentioned, but the context implies that the ASPERA-3 and MEX OA systems are part of a larger software system.
