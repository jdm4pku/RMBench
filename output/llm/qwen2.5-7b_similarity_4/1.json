Here are some examples: the patient, the sun, the old.\n'External System': is a manually designed domain that can store data messages. Here are some examples: a database, a magnetic stripe card, a tap, hard disk.\n'System Requirements': is the aim and purpose of the system to be developed. \n'Shared Phenomena': is a set of shared events, states and values between the connected entities.\n\n## Examples\nInput:The Tactical Control System HCI shall provide for the capability to automatically designate target locations from the payload screen onto the map screen.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System HCI'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the payload screen', 'the map screen'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['provide for the capability to automatically designate target locations from the payload screen onto the map screen'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.\nAnswer:{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': ['Each presentation segment'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['a clear and sufficient indication']}\nInput:The Tactical Control System shall have the capability to select and deselect several types of cross hairs (or other similar ICON) to identify a selected point on a target.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['to select and deselect several types of cross hairs (or other similar ICON) to identify a selected point on a target'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nInput:The Tactical Control System shall have the capability to display Near-Real Time (NRT) imagery to include, as a minimum, date/time group, target location coordinates when the target is in the center of the field of view, north seeking arrow, and AV position and heading.\nAnswer:{'Software System': ['The Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['to display Near-Real Time (NRT) imagery', 'date/time group', 'target location coordinates', 'north seeking arrow', 'AV position and heading'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\n## Test\nInput:Once an Center is selected, the user shall be able to select a LCS from a list and provide the following information, including Target LCS and Assignment of lane arrows.\nAnswer: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['shall be able to select a LCS from a list and provide the following information', 'Target LCS', 'Assignment of lane arrows'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\n## Explanation\nThe input sentence contains the user as an environment object, and the system requirements are to select a LCS from a list and provide the following information.

The web server application is the software system that will use this external system to create map images. Therefore, the entities are extracted based on this understanding. \n\n## Task\nThe software system will be a web-based application that will be used to manage and display data from a database.\n## Expected JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [\"a web-based application\"], \n  \"Physical Device\": [], \n  \"Environment Object\": [], \n  \"External System\": [\"a database\"], \n  \"System Requirements\": [], \n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```\n## Rationale\nThe sentence specifies that the software system will be a web-based application, which is the primary software to be developed. It also mentions that this application will manage and display data from a database, indicating that the database is an external system used by the software system.
