The hospital's patient management system is an external system that the software needs to communicate with. Here is the correct answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [\"hospital's patient management system\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n``` \n\nThis correctly identifies the \"hospital's patient management system\" as an external system that the software needs to communicate with. The other entity types are not relevant in this context. \n\nIf you have more examples or need further assistance, feel free to ask! \n\n## New Task\nInput: The system should be able to communicate with the hospital's patient management system and store patient data in a local database.\nAnswer: {\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [\"hospital's patient management system\"], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\nThe answer is partially correct but incomplete. The \"External System\" entity is correctly identified, but the \"External System\" should also include the \"local database\" where patient data is stored. Here is the correct answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Software System\": [],\n  \"Physical Device\": [],\n  \"Environment Object\": [],\n  \"External System\": [\"hospital's patient management system\", \"local database\"],\n  \"System Requirements\": [],\n  \"Shared Phenomena\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis correctly identifies both the \"hospital's patient management system\" and the \"local database\" as external systems. The other entity types are not relevant in this context. \n\nIf you have more examples or need further assistance, feel free to ask! \n\n## New Task\nInput: The system should be able to communicate with the hospital's patient management system and store patient data in a local database.
