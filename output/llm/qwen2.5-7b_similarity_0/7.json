It also mentions the patient's medical records and the patient's temperature, which are environment objects. The system requirements are not explicitly stated in the sentence. Physical devices are not mentioned in the sentence.

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis aligns with the task's requirement to return an empty list for non-existent entity types. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer. \n\n```json\n{\"Software System\": [], \"Physical Device\": [], \"Environment Object\": [], \"External System\": [], \"System Requirements\": [], \"Shared Phenomena\": []}\n``` \n\nThis is the final answer."
