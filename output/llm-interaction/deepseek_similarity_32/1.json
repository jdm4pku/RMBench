So, the requirements are part of the system, but the system is the ATMS. So, the requirements are assigned numbers that are a combination of target ATMS and sequential within a given functional area. So, the requirements are part of the ATMS system. So, the 'System Requirements' would be the requirements themselves. But in the entity list, 'System Requirements' is empty. So, perhaps the requirements are part of the 'System Requirements' but not listed here. So, the answer is that there are no Phenomena Interfaces, no requirements reference, and no requirements constraint.\n\nBut wait, the task is to extract relations based on the schema. The schema has three types: Interface, Requirements Reference, and Requirements Constraint.\n\nLooking at the input sentence: \"The Requirement Numbers are a combination of target Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) and sequential within a given functional area.\"\n\nSo, the entities involved are:\n\n- Software System: empty\n- Physical Device: empty\n- Environment Object: empty\n- External System: ['Advanced Traffic Management System']\n- System Requirements: empty\n- Shared Phenomena: empty\n\nThe sentence is talking about the Requirement Numbers, which are part of the System Requirements.

So, perhaps the Requirements are part of the 'External System' (ATMS) or 'Software System' (but it's empty). So, the Requirements are part of the ATMS's system requirements.\n\nBut the schema defines:\n\n- Interface: between entities that send/receive data.\n- Requirements Reference: reference between requirements domain and other entities.\n- Requirements Constraint: constrain relation between requirements domain and other entities.\n\nIn this case, the Requirements are part of the ATMS, which is an External System. So, the Requirements are in the ATMS's System Requirements. But in the entity list, the 'System Requirements' is empty, so perhaps the Requirements are part of the External System's System Requirements.\n\nWait, the entity list has 'External System' as ['Advanced Traffic Management System'], and 'System Requirements' is empty.
