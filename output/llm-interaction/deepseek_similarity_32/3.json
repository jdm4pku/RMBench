So, the answer should be an empty list for all relations.\n\nBut wait, the entities in the test input are all empty. So, the 'Software System' is empty, 'System Requirements' is empty.

But according to the schema, the 'requirements constraint' should be present because the 'System Requirements' is a constraint on the 'Shared Phenomena' (the audit trail data). So why is the answer empty?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the schema. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe schema defines three relation types:\n- Interface: between entities that send/receive data.\n- Requirements Reference: references between requirements and other entities.\n- Requirements Constraint: constraints between requirements and other entities, meaning the requirements domain doesn't just refer but constrains them.\n\nIn the given input, the sentence is about the audit trail data being unalterable. The 'System Requirements' is 'unalterable', which is a constraint on the 'Shared Phenomena' (the audit trail data). So the relation should be 'requirements constraint' between 'System Requirements' and 'Shared Phenomena'.\n\nBut in the example, the answer is empty. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the example is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, in the first example, the answer is empty because the sentence doesn't mention any interface or reference. But in this case, the 'System Requirements' is a constraint on 'Shared Phenomena', so it should be captured as a 'requirements constraint'.\n\nSo the correct answer should have a 'requirements constraint' relation between 'System Requirements' and 'Shared Phenomena'. But the example shows an empty list. Maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps the system is not capturing it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'System Requirements' is not considered a constraint but a reference. But according to the schema, 'requirements constraint' is when the requirements domain constrains another entity, not just refers to it.\n\nSo I think the correct answer should include a 'requirements constraint' relation. Therefore, the example might be wrong, or perhaps I'm misapplying the schema.\n\nWait, looking at the last example provided:\n\nInput:Software shall be provided that allows an authorized user full access to all messaging, monitor, and control traffic.\nEntity: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['an authorized user'], 'External System': ['Software'], 'System Requirements': ['access to all messaging,', 'monitor, and control traffic'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer:{'Phenomena Interface': [['Software', 'an authorized user']], 'requirements reference': [['an authorized user', 'access to all messaging,'], ['an authorized user', 'monitor, and control traffic']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nHere, the 'requirements reference' is correctly captured because the 'System Requirements' refers to the 'Environment Object' (the user). So in this case, the 'requirements reference' is present.\n\nIn the test case, the 'System Requirements' is a constraint on the 'Shared Phenomena'. So the 'requirements constraint' should be present.\n\nTherefore, the example answer is incorrect. The correct answer should have a 'requirements constraint' relation.\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': [['System Requirements', 'Shared Phenomena']]}\n\nBut according to the example, it's empty. Maybe the system is not capturing it because the 'System Requirements' is directly part of the same entity. Or perhaps the 'Shared Phenomena' is not considered as an external entity.\n\nWait, in the entity list, 'Shared Phenomena' is a separate entity, so the 'System Requirements' is a constraint on it. Therefore, the relation should be present.\n\nSo, the correct answer should include a 'requirements constraint' between 'System Requirements' and 'Shared Phenomena'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"System Requirements\", \"Shared Phenomena\"]]\n}\n```"

It includes 'Physical Requirements' as a key. So, in this case, the entity list is {'Software System': [], 'Physical Requirements': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n\nSo, the task is to extract the relations based on the schema.\n\nSo, the task is to process the input sentence and the given entity list, and extract all the relations that match the schema definition.\n\nThe schema defines three relation types:\n1. Interface: between two entities where one is an interface (sending/receiving data)\n2. Requirements Reference: a reference relation between requirements domain and other entities\n3. Requirements Constraint: a constrain relation between requirements domain and other entities, meaning the requirements domain doesn't just refer to phenomena but constrains them.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Parse the input sentence to identify all entities and their relationships.\n2. For each identified relationship, determine which of the three relation types it falls into.\n3. Collect all the relations that match each type.\n4. Return the result as a JSON string with the three keys, each containing the list of matching relations.\n\nNow, the challenge is to correctly identify the relations and map them to the correct type.\n\nFirst, let's look at the example where the input is \"The Tactical Control System shall be approved for operation at the same level as the systems with which it interfaces.\" and the entity list includes 'The Tactical Control System' as a Software System, 'it interfaces' as Shared Phenomena, and 'the same level as the systems' as External System.\n\nThe output is that the Phenomena Interface is between 'The Tactical Control System' and 'it interfaces', and the Requirements Constraint is between 'the same level as the systems' and 'The Tactical Control System'.\n\nSo, in this case, the 'it interfaces' is the interface, and 'The Tactical Control System' is the system providing the interface. So, the Phenomena Interface is between these two.\n\nThe 'the same level as the systems' is an External System, and the Tactical Control System is a Software System. The relation is a constraint because the Tactical Control System must conform to the level of the systems it interfaces with.\n\nSo, the Requirements Constraint is between the Software System (Tactical Control System) and the External System (the same level as the systems).\n\nAnother example: \"Software tools will be provided to assist the user at all access levels from system wide configuration and control to"

So, in this case, the error messages are being sent from the software system to the user. The software system is the entity that's sending the data, and the user is the entity receiving it. So, the interface here is the user interface through which the error messages are displayed. \n\nBut in the given entities, the Software System is not listed as an entity that can send data. The entities provided are Users, Software System, etc. So, perhaps the Software System is the one sending the error messages to the User. Therefore, the interface in question is the User Interface, which connects the Software System to the User. \n\nSo, the Phenomena Interface would be between the Software System and the User, with the data being the error messages. Therefore, the Phenomena Interface would be Software System -> User, with the data being 'error messages'. \n\nBut in the entities, the Software System is not in the list of entities that can send data. Wait, the entities are: Software System, Physical Device, Environment Object, External System, System Requirements, Shared Phenomena. So, the Software System is an entity, and the User is an Environment Object. \n\nSo, the interface is between the Software System and the User.

Therefore, the Phenomena Interface is Software System and User, with the data being error messages. \n\nBut in the given entities, the Software System is not in the list of entities that can send data.

So, the Software System is an entity, and the User is an Environment Object. \n\nSo, the interface is between the Software System and the User.

The sentence is: \"Each link displayed on the map shall be color coded to provide a graphical depiction of speeds.\"\n\nLooking at the entity list, the entities are:\n- Software System: []\n- Physical Device: []\n- Environment Object: ['the map', 'Each link']\n- External System: []\n- System Requirements: ['to provide a graphical depiction of speeds']\n- Shared Phenomena: []\n\nFrom the sentence, the key entities involved are 'the map' and 'Each link' as Environment Objects, and 'to provide a graphical depiction of speeds' as a System Requirement.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relations based on the schema:\n1. **Phenomena Interface**: This relates an interface between two entities where one is a Software System or Physical Device and the other is an Environment Object or Shared Phenomena. In this case, 'Each link' is an Environment Object, and 'the map' is also an Environment Object. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state a direct interface between them through the Software System. Instead, the Software System (Tactical Control System) is implied to be providing the interface. But since the Software System isn't explicitly mentioned here, I'm not sure if this counts. Alternatively, maybe 'the map' is a Physical Device, but it's not listed. So perhaps this isn't applicable.\n\n2. **Requirements Reference**: This is a reference relation between System Requirements and other entities. Here, 'to provide a graphical depiction of speeds' is a System Requirement, and it refers to 'Each link' and 'the map'. So this would be a Requirements Reference between the System Requirement and the Environment Objects.\n\n3. **Requirements Constraint**: This would be if the System Requirements constrain other entities. Here, the System Requirement is about providing a graphical depiction, which doesn't constrain but rather refers to the objects. So no constraint here.\n\nPutting it all together, the Phenomena Interface might not be directly applicable since the Software System isn't explicitly mentioned. The Requirements Reference is clear between the System Requirement and the Environment Objects.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [\n    [\"Each link\", \"the map\"],\n    [\"the map\", \"to provide a graphical depiction of speeds\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements reference\": [\n    [\"to provide a graphical depiction of speeds\", \"Each link\"],\n    [\"to provide a graphical depiction of speeds\", \"the map\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```"
