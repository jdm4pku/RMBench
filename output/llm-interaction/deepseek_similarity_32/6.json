But according to the schema, the Phenomena Interface is between Software System and Environment Object, or other entities. So, in this case, the sentence is about the transition from the system to external content, but the entities don't have Software System or External System. So, the answer is correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say the input is \"The system must interact with the external system.\" The entities are {'Software System': ['the system'], 'External System': ['the external system']}. So, the Phenomena Interface would be between 'the system' and 'the external system'. So the answer should have 'Phenomena Interface' with that pair.\n\nBut in the given test case, the entities don't have Software System or External System, so the answer is empty.\n\nSo, the process is: parse the sentence, identify all pairs of entities that are connected via Phenomena Interface, Requirements Reference, or Requirements Constraint.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Identify all entities in the sentence.\n2. For each possible pair of entities, determine the type of relation between them.\n3. Based on the schema, collect the relations that match.\n\nSo, for each sentence, we need to:\n\n- Extract all entities from the sentence, matching the entity list.\n- For each pair of entities, determine if they are connected via Phenomena Interface, Requirements Reference, or Requirements Constraint.\n\nThe Phenomena Interface is when an interface exists between two entities, which are connected via data sending/receiving.\n\nThe Requirements Reference is when one entity refers to another in the context of requirements.\n\nThe Requirements Constraint is when one entity constrains another in the context of requirements.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each sentence, extract all entities and their types (from the entity list).\n- For each pair of entities (A, B), determine the relation type.\n\nHow to determine the relation type:\n\n- Phenomena Interface: If A is a Software System and B is an Environment Object, or vice versa, and they are interacting via an interface. Or, if A is a Physical Device and B is a Software System, etc. Wait, no, the schema says Interface is an interface of sending/receiving data between connected entities. So, any two entities that are connected via an interface would be a Phenomena Interface relation.\n\nWait, the schema says:\n\n'Interface': is an interface of sending/receving data between the connected entities.\n\nSo, any"
