It should be only one. So the correct answer should be:\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nBut the user's answer had a duplicate. So the correct answer is as above.\n\nSo, the task is to extract all relations that match the schema definition from the given sentence and entity list. The schema defines three relation types: Interface, Requirements Reference, and Requirements Constraint. \n\nThe task is to find all instances where these relations occur between the entities mentioned in the sentence and the entities in the provided entity list. \n\nEach relation is a pair of entities (A, B) where A is the source and B is the target. \n\nFor the 'Interface' relation, it's when an interface exists between two entities, meaning they communicate or interact. \n\nFor 'Requirements Reference', it's when a requirement refers to another entity, possibly as a dependency or reference. \n\nFor 'Requirements Constraint', it's when a requirement imposes a constraint on another entity, affecting its behavior or operation. \n\nThe output should be a JSON object with each relation type as a key, and the value is a list of pairs (A, B). If a relation type has no instances, it should be an empty list. \n\nThe answer should be a JSON string, with the keys in the order: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', 'Requirements Constraint'. \n\nSo, for each sentence, we need to parse it, identify all pairs of entities that fit into these relations, and then map them accordingly. \n\nIn the test case, the input sentence is: \"The APAF ground data system requirements are categorized according to functional areas and are defined in the following sections in table"
