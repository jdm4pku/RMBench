This can be inaccurate if the sentence structure or wording is not aligned with the predefined keywords.\n- **Limited Scope:** The schema definition only includes three relation types.

In real-world scenarios, there might be multiple possible relations for a given entity pair. You could address this by:\n    - Using a probabilistic approach to assign probabilities to different relation types.\n    - Allowing for multiple relations to be associated with a single entity pair.\n- **Expanding Schema:** The current schema is limited.
