The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data sets are to be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and analysis, which means the data sets will be available and can be analyzed from the archive. This matches the 'Phenomena Interface' relation type as the data sets are being stored on the archive.
