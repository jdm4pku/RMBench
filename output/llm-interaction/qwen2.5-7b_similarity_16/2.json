The sentence states that the Correlator Monitor and Control System shall provide a user interface that is suitable for users with special needs. This implies that the system must ensure its user interface is compatible with specialist software and appropriate interface guidelines for users with special needs. Therefore, the correct output should include a 'requirements constraint' between the Correlator Monitor and Control System and the users, indicating that the system must ensure its user interface is suitable for users with special needs.

The sentence states that the Correlator Monitor and Control System shall provide a user interface that is suitable for users with special needs.

Therefore, the correct output should include a 'requirements constraint' between the Correlator Monitor and Control System and the users, indicating that the system must ensure its user interface is suitable for users with special needs. The 'Phenomena Interface' should also include the relationship between the system and the users, as the system needs to provide a suitable user interface for them.

The 'Phenomena Interface' includes the relationship between the system and the users, and the 'requirements constraint' includes the requirement that the system must provide a suitable user interface for users with special needs.
