The sentence is more about the user's knowledge and does not impose any constraints or references to other entities.

The relation 'Phenomena Interface' is correctly identified for the interaction between 'DigitalHome system' and 'a web interface', and 'the general user' and 'a web interface'. The relation 'requirements reference' is also correctly identified for the user's ability to perform simple web operations.

The schema defines three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. You need to identify and extract the relations that match these schema definitions and return the results in a JSON format. If a relation does not exist in the sentence, return an empty list for that relation type.\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Identify the Relation Types**: Look for phrases or words that indicate an 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', or 'Requirements Constraint'.\n2. **Extract the Entities**: Identify the entities involved in the relation.\n3. **Format the Output**: Return the extracted relations in a JSON format as specified in the schema.\n\n## Example Walkthrough\n### Input\n\"The software will provide a high resolution computer generated graphical user interface that enables a UAV operator trained on one system to control different types of UAVs or UAV payloads with a minimum of additional training.\"\n### Entities\n{'Software System': ['software'], 'Physical Device': ['high resolution computer'], 'Environment Object': ['UAV operator', 'UAVs', 'UAV payloads'], 'External System': ['graphical user interface'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n### Output\n{'Phenomena Interface': [['software', 'graphical user interface'], ['high resolution computer', 'graphical user interface'], ['graphical user interface', 'UAV operator'], ['graphical user interface', 'UAVs'], ['graphical user interface', 'UAV payloads']], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\n### Explanation\n- **Phenomena Interface**: The sentence describes how the software, high resolution computer, and graphical user interface interact with UAV operators, UAVs, and UAV payloads.\n- **Requirements Reference**: No specific reference to requirements is found.\n- **Requirements Constraint**: No specific constraints are mentioned.\n\n## Solution\n### Input\n\"However, the simulated environment will be realistic and adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home and to real sensors and controllers.\"\n### Entities\n{'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['sensors', 'controllers'], 'Environment Object': ['an actual home'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Phenomena Interface**: No specific interfaces are mentioned.\n- **Requirements Reference**: No specific references to requirements are found.\n- **Requirements Constraint**: The simulated environment adheres to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home, which constrains the sensors and controllers. Therefore, the constraints are between the actual home and the sensors/controllers. ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]\n"
