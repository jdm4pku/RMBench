The sentence describes a requirement for the backup system to be activated in the event of a system failure, which implies a 'requirements reference' between 'the backup system' and 'the system failure'. The 'Phenomena Interface' and 'requirements constraint' relation types should be correctly identified as empty lists. The correct output should be:\n```json\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['the backup system', 'be activated to ensure continuous operation in the event of a system failure']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n```\n\n## Test\nInput:To ensure the system is user-friendly, the user interface shall be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.\nEntities: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate'], 'Shared Phenomena': []} \nOutput: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['the user interface', 'be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n## Evaluation\nThe output is correct. The sentence describes a requirement for the user interface to be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, which implies a 'requirements reference' between 'the user interface' and the requirement. The 'Phenomena Interface' and 'requirements constraint' relation types are correctly identified as empty lists. The correct output is:\n```json\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['the user interface', 'be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n``` The output is correct. The sentence describes a requirement for the user interface to be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, which implies a 'requirements reference' between 'the user interface' and the requirement. The 'Phenomena Interface' and 'requirements constraint' relation types are correctly identified as empty lists. The correct output is:\n\n```json\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['the user interface', 'be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n``` \n\nThis output accurately captures the requirement reference without any additional phenomena interfaces or constraints. \n\nIf you have more test cases or need further assistance, feel free to let me know!"

The 'requirements reference' is left empty as there are no clear references to other entities in the context of requirements.
