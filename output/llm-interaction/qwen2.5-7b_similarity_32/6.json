The schema includes three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. The task is to identify and return the relations that match these schema types, and return an empty list for non-existent relations. The output should be in the form of a JSON string. \n\n## Guidelines\n- The input will be a sentence from a software requirements specification and a list of entities.\n- The output should be a JSON string with three keys: 'Phenomena Interface', 'requirements reference', and 'requirements constraint'. Each key should map to a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a relation between two entities.\n- If a relation does not exist in the sentence, the corresponding list should be empty.\n- The order of the entities in the tuple does not matter.\n- The schema types are 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. \n\n## Example\nInput: \"This document is designed to provide information to both the client and the technical designers of the software.\"\nEntities: {'Software System': ['the software'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the technical designers', 'the client'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []} \n\nOutput: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []} \n\nIn this example, there are no relations that match the schema types, so all lists are empty. \n\n## Test\nInput: \"The software will provide the UAV operator the necessary tools for computer related communications, mission tasking, mission planning, mission execution, data receipt, data processing, limited data exploitation, and data dissemination.\"\nEntities: {'Software System': ['software'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['UAV operator'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['tools']} \n\nOutput: {'Phenomena Interface': [['software', 'tools'], ['UAV operator', 'tools']], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []} \n\nIn this example, the sentence describes a relation between the software and the tools, and between the UAV operator and the tools, which are 'Requirements Constraint' relations.

The schema definition includes three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'.\n2. 'Interface' refers to an interface of sending/receiving data between connected entities.\n3. 'Requirements Reference' refers to a reference relation between requirements domain and other entities.\n4. 'Requirements Constraint' refers to a constrain relation between requirements domain and other entities, meaning the requirements domain does not just refer to the phenomena but constrains them.\n5. The answer should be in the format of a JSON string.\n6. If a relation does not exist in the sentence, return an empty list for that relation type.\n\n## Example\nInput:\nSentence: \"Section one is a brief overview of the product, including definitions and references.\"\nEntities: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nOutput:\n{\"Phenomena Interface\": [], \"requirements reference\": [], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this task, follow these steps:\n1. Parse the input sentence to identify any entities mentioned.\n2. Check if the sentence contains any references or constraints related to the entities.\n3. For each relation type, check if the sentence contains a reference or constraint.\n4. If a relation is found, extract the entities involved and format them as a list.\n5. If no relation is found, return an empty list for that relation type.\n6. Format the output as a JSON string with the relation types as keys and the extracted entities as values. ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```"
