The schema defines three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. The input sentence and a list of entities are provided. The goal is to identify and extract the relevant relations that match the schema definitions.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations**: The sentence and the list of entities are analyzed to find any entities that match the schema definitions.\n2. **Extract Relations**: Based on the schema, the relations are extracted and categorized into 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'.\n3. **Return JSON Format**: The extracted relations are returned in a JSON format as specified.\n\n### Example Breakdown\n- **Example 1**:\n  - **Input**: \"The HCI shall prompt the operator for a valid input.\"\n  - **Entities**: {'Software System': ['The HCI'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the operator'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['prompt the operator for a valid input'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['a valid input']}\n  - **Answer**: {\"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"The HCI\", \"a valid input\"]], \"requirements reference\": [], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n  - **Explanation**: The HCI is an interface for sending/receiving data, and it prompts the operator for a valid input, which is a shared phenomenon.\n\n- **Example 2**:\n  - **Input**: \"Once an Center is selected, the user shall be able to issue a CCTV switching command, including Source (input) and Destination port (output).\"\n  - **Entities**: {'Software System': ['an Center'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': ['a CCTV switching command', 'Source', 'Destination port']}\n  - **Answer**: {\"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"an Center\", \"a CCTV switching command\"], [\"the user\", \"a CCTV switching command\"], [\"an Center\", \"Source\"], [\"the user\", \"Source\"], [\"an Center\", \"Destination port\"], [\"the user\", \"Destination port\"]], \"requirements reference\": [], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n  - **Explanation**: The Center is an interface for sending/receiving data, and the user can issue a CCTV switching command, which includes Source and Destination port as inputs and outputs.\n\n### Test Case Breakdown\n- **Test Input**: \"The component actively listens for the player's input and, upon selection, proceeds according to the player's decision.\"\n- **Entities**: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the player'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n- **Answer**: {\"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"the player\", \"the player's input\"]], \"requirements reference\": [], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n- **Explanation**: The component is an interface for listening to the player's input, which is a shared phenomenon.\n\n### JSON Format\nThe answer is returned in a JSON format with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [...],\n  \"requirements reference\": [...],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"the player\", \"the player's input\"]],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```"

It means the requirements domains does not just refer to the phenomena but constrains them. \n\n## Examples\nInput:The Tactical Control System’s operating system and executable software shall be re-programmable without hardware disassembly.\nEntity: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['The Tactical Control System’s operating system', 'executable software'], 'System Requirements': ['re-programmable without hardware disassembly'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer:{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\nInput:Training software shall be alterable without affecting the configuration of the operational software.\nEntity: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': ['the operational software', 'Training software'], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer:{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\n\n## Test\nInput:This system allows for real-time updates to the game's content without the need for system restarts or interruptions, enabling a seamless integration of new or revised educational material into the game sequence.\nEntities: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []} \nOutput: ```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` \n## Explanation\nThe input sentence does not contain any references to interfaces, requirements, or constraints that match the provided schema definitions.
