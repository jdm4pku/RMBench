The schema defines three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. The input includes a sentence from a software requirements specification and a list of entities. The goal is to identify which entities are related according to the schema and return the relations in a JSON format.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations**: The sentence mentions a 'carrier board for the CMIB' and a 'visible indicator'. The visible indicator is supposed to provide a user with a physical indication of the CMIB's operational status.\n2. **Determine Relation Types**:\n   - **Interface**: The visible indicator is an interface for the user to get information about the CMIB's operational status.\n   - **Requirements Reference**: There is no direct reference to other entities in the sentence.\n   - **Requirements Constraint**: The visible indicator constrains the user to get a physical indication of the CMIB's operational status.\n\n### JSON Format\nThe JSON format should list the relations for each type of schema.\n\n### Solution\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"The carrier board for the CMIB\", \"visible indicator\"], [\"a user\", \"visible indicator\"]],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [[\"a physical indication of CMIB operational status\", \"visible indicator\"]]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Phenomena Interface**: The visible indicator is an interface for the user to get information about the CMIB's operational status.\n- **Requirements Reference**: No direct reference to other entities is mentioned.\n- **Requirements Constraint**: The visible indicator constrains the user to get a physical indication of the CMIB's operational status. \n\nThis solution accurately captures the relations based on the provided schema and entities."

The UPS devices need the ability to signal the Correlator Monitor and Control System when a power outage has occurred. This can be represented as a 'Interface' relation between 'The UPS devices' and 'the Correlator Monitor and Control System'.\n2. The UPS devices need the ability to keep the Correlator Monitor and Control System apprised of time remaining on backup power.

'the Correlator Monitor and Control System' is referenced twice in the sentence, which can be represented as a 'Requirements Reference' relation between 'the Correlator Monitor and Control System' and itself. \n\nTherefore, the output JSON string is: {'Phenomena Interface': [['The UPS devices', 'signal'], ['The UPS devices', 'time remaining on backup power']], 'requirements reference': [['the Correlator Monitor and Control System', 'the Correlator Monitor and Control System']], 'requirements constraint': [['The UPS devices', 'time remaining on backup power']]} ## Output\n```json\n{'Phenomena Interface': [['The UPS devices', 'signal'], ['The UPS devices', 'time remaining on backup power']], 'requirements reference': [['The UPS devices', 'the Correlator Monitor and Control System'], ['the Correlator Monitor and Control System', 'the Correlator Monitor and Control System']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n```"

The schema includes three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. The goal is to identify and list the relations that match these schema types from the input sentence and the provided entity list. The output should be in the form of a JSON string, with each relation type as a key and a list of matching relations as the value. If no relation matches a specific type, the value should be an empty list.\n\n## Guidelines for Solution\n1. **Understand the Schema**: The schema defines three types of relations: 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'.\n2. **Analyze the Input Sentence**: Carefully read the sentence to identify any references or constraints related to the entities.\n3. **Match with Entities**: Use the provided entity list to match the entities mentioned in the sentence with the schema.\n4. **Extract Relations**: For each entity, check if the sentence contains a reference or constraint. If it does, add it to the corresponding list in the output JSON.\n5. **Format the Output**: Ensure the output is in the correct JSON format, with each relation type as a key and a list of matching relations as the value.\n\n## Solution\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [[\"the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System\", \"all past access\"], [\"the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System\", \"all attempts\"]],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis solution correctly identifies the 'requirements reference' relations between the 'the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System' and the 'all past access' and 'all attempts' entities, while no 'Interface' or 'Requirements Constraint' relations are found in the given sentence. The output is formatted as a JSON string as required."

You need to identify the entities and their relationships based on the schema and return the results in a JSON format.\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Identify the Entities**: Use the provided entity list to identify the relevant entities in the sentence.\n2. **Determine the Relations**: Based on the schema definitions, determine which relations (Interface, Requirements Reference, Requirements Constraint) are present in the sentence.\n3. **Format the Output**: Return the results in a JSON format with the appropriate keys and values.\n\n## Example Walkthrough\n### Input\nThe administrator shall have the ability to create and add a new user to the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System.\n\n### Entities\n- Software System: ['the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System']\n- Physical Device: []\n- Environment Object: ['The administrator', 'a new user']\n- External System: []\n- System Requirements: []\n- Shared Phenomena: ['create and add a new user']\n\n### Analysis\n- **Interface**: The administrator (entity) and the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System (entity) have an interface.\n- **Requirements Reference**: The administrator (entity) references the ability to create and add a new user (phenomenon).\n- **Requirements Constraint**: There is no constraint mentioned in the sentence.\n\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System\", \"The administrator\"]],\n  \"requirements reference\": [[\"create and add a new user\", \"The administrator\"]],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```\n\n## Solution\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System\", \"The administrator\"]],\n  \"requirements reference\": [[\"create and add a new user\", \"The administrator\"]],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```"
