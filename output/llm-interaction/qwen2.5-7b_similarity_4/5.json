The relations to be extracted are 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. The schema defines what each relation type means and how to extract it from the sentence. The answer should be returned as a JSON string.\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Identify the Entities**: Use the provided entity list to identify the relevant entities in the sentence.\n2. **Extract Relations**: Based on the schema, extract the relations that match the defined types.\n3. **Return JSON**: Format the answer as a JSON string with the extracted relations.\n\n## Solution\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data\"], [\"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\", \"intermediate files\"], [\"ASPERA-3 Co-I’s\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"]],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON string correctly identifies the 'Phenomena Interface' relations based on the provided sentence and entities, while the 'requirements reference' and 'requirements constraint' relations are not present in the sentence, so they are returned as empty lists.

The 'Physical Device' and 'Environment Object' entities are not relevant to the relations in this sentence, so they are not included in the answer. The 'Software System' and 'External System' entities are also not relevant, and the 'System Requirements' entity is not used in forming the relations.
