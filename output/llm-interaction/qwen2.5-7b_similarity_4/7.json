The relations are extracted based on the schema definitions provided. The 'Phenomena Interface' relation is used for the data flow between the Tactical Control System and the other entities.

You need to identify the relations that fit into the categories of 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'. If a relation does not exist in the sentence, return an empty list for that category. The output should be in the form of a JSON string.\n\n## Guidelines\n- The schema definitions are 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'.\n- 'Interface' refers to the data communication between entities.\n- 'Requirements Reference' refers to the reference relation between requirements and other entities.\n- 'Requirements Constraint' refers to the constraint relation between requirements and other entities.\n- The input will be a sentence and a list of entities.\n- The output should be a JSON string with the relations categorized as per the schema definitions.\n\n## Solution\n```json\n{\n  \"Interface\": [[\"standard DoD C4I systems\"]],\n  \"Requirements Reference\": [],\n  \"Requirements Constraint\": []\n}\n``` \n\n## Rationale\nThe sentence mentions that the communications procedures, formats, and interfaces will be interoperable with selected standard DoD C4I systems, architectures, and protocols. This indicates an interface relation with the 'standard DoD C4I systems'. There is no reference or constraint relation mentioned in the sentence, so those categories are left empty.

The correct output should be:\n\n```json\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': [['The system', 'operate in a degraded mode']]}\n``` The system's ability to operate in a degraded mode is a constraint on the system's behavior, which falls under the 'requirements constraint' category.

The output correctly identifies this constraint. \n\nThe final output is:\n\n```json\n{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': [['The system', 'operate in a degraded mode']]}\n``` \n\nThis ensures that the system's requirement to operate in a degraded mode is accurately captured as a constraint. \n\nIf you have any further inputs or need additional clarifications, feel free to ask!"

The task is to extract the relevant relations based on the provided schema. \n\n1. **Phenomena Interface**: The Tactical Control System interacts with the operator to allow the entry and review of mission plan parameters. This interaction is a form of data exchange, which can be categorized as a Phenomena Interface.\n2. **Requirements Reference**: The Tactical Control System is required to allow the operator to enter and review mission plan parameters, which includes specific types of parameters like AV flight parameters, payload control parameters, data link control parameters, AV VCR control parameters, and AV loiter patterns. This requirement is a reference to the functionalities of the system.\n3. **Requirements Constraint**: There is no explicit constraint mentioned in the sentence that would fit the 'Requirements Constraint' schema.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the output JSON string is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"review mission plan parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV flight parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"payload control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"data link control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV VCR control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV loiter patterns\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements reference\": [\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"review mission plan parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV flight parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"payload control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"data link control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV VCR control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV loiter patterns\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` \nThis JSON string accurately reflects the relations extracted from the input sentence based on the provided schema. ## Output\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"review mission plan parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV flight parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"payload control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"data link control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV VCR control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV loiter patterns\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements reference\": [\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"review mission plan parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV flight parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"payload control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"data link control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV VCR control parameters\"],\n    [\"Tactical Control System\", \"AV loiter patterns\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` \n```"

The `Phenomena Interface` correctly identifies the interface between the `Tactical Control System` and the `status of the system`.

This is a reference to the system requirements, not an interface or a constraint. Therefore, the correct output is as shown above. The system name \"The Tactical Control System\" is used instead of \"The Tactical Control System software\" for brevity and clarity. Both are acceptable, but the second version is more concise. \n\nIf you prefer the full name, the output would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [],\n  \"requirements reference\": [[\"The Tactical Control System software\", \"hosted on a variety of computer operating systems\"]],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` \n\nLet me know if you need any further adjustments!"

This is a requirement constraint as it specifies a constraint on the system's behavior. The phrase \"minimize alphanumeric data display\" is a shared phenomenon that the system must adhere to, and it is referenced in the requirement.

The system is required to provide a specific icon shape and other visual information coding mechanisms to the Tactical Control System operator to indicate which UAVs are under their primary control. \n\n- 'The Tactical Control System' is the software system that provides the specific icon shape and other visual information coding mechanisms.\n- 'a specific icon shape' and 'other visual
