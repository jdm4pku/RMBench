    "predict": " Answer:{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['the Center-to-Center (C2C) Communications Network', 'a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) C2C project']], 'requirements constraint': []} \n## Rationale\nThe input sentence refers to the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) providing requirements for the Center-to-Center (C2C) Communications Network, which is based on a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) C2C project. This indicates a reference relation between the C2C Communications Network and the TxDOT C2C project. There is no indication of an interface or a constraint relation. Therefore, the correct answer is an empty list for 'Phenomena Interface' and 'requirements constraint', and a reference relation for 'requirements reference'. ## Answer\n```json\n{\"Phenomena Interface\": [], \"requirements reference\": [[\"the Center-to-Center (C2C) Communications Network\", \"a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) C2C project\"]], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n```"

Based on the schema definition, the relations can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **Phenomena Interface**: The Center should be able to interface with the device control command, network identifier, reversible lane identifier, username, password, plan, and duration.\n2. **Requirements Reference**: The requirement to support Reversible Lane control in other centers refers to the device control command.\n3. **Requirements Constraint**: The requirement to support Reversible Lane control in other centers constrains the network identifier, reversible lane identifier, username, password, plan, and duration.\n\nThus, the extracted relations are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [\n    [\"the Center\", \"device control command\"],\n    [\"the Center\", \"network identifier\"],\n    [\"the Center\", \"reversible lane identifier\"],\n    [\"the Center\", \"username\"],\n    [\"the Center\", \"password\"],\n    [\"the Center\", \"plan\"],\n    [\"the Center\", \"duration\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements reference\": [\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"device control command\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"network identifier\"],\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"reversible lane identifier\"],\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"username\"],\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"password\"],\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"plan\"],\n    [\"To support Reversible Lane control in other centers\", \"duration\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n## Task\nYou are an expert specialising in building problem diagrams and entity extraction. \nGiven the sentence from a software requirements specification and an entity list, extract all relation that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent relation types.\nPlease answer in the format of a JSON string. \n\n## Schema Definition\n['Interface', 'Requirements Reference', 'Requirements Constraint']\n'Interface': is an interface of sending/receving data between the connected entities.\n'Requirements Reference': is reference relation between requirements domain and other entities.\n'Requirements Constraint': is constrain relation between requirements domain and other entities.

The input includes a sentence from a software requirements specification and a list of entities. The goal is to identify and categorize the relations that match the schema definitions.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Identify Entities**: The entities are provided in the input, and the task is to match the sentence with these entities.\n2. **Extract Relations**: Based on the sentence, determine if it matches any of the schema definitions:\n   - **Interface**: Data transfer between entities.\n   - **Requirements Reference**: Reference to requirements.\n   - **Requirements Constraint**: Constraints on requirements.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n- **Input**: \"The map shall be capable of displaying the following for a CCTV.\"\n- **Entities**: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['The map', 'a CCTV'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\n- **Output**: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['The map', 'a CCTV']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\n### Explanation\n- **Requirements Reference**: The sentence mentions that the map is capable of displaying something for a CCTV, which implies a reference to the requirements.\n- **Phenomena Interface**: There is no direct data transfer or interaction described, so no phenomena interface is identified.\n- **Requirements Constraint**: No constraints are mentioned, so no requirements constraint is identified.\n\n### JSON Format\nThe output is formatted as a JSON string with the keys corresponding to the schema definitions and the values being lists of relations.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"Phenomena Interface\": [], \"requirements reference\": [[\"The map\", \"a CCTV\"]], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n``` \n\nThis JSON string correctly identifies the relations based on the given sentence and entities. The task is to follow this format for all inputs. \n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that the sentence is carefully read to identify any implicit or explicit references, constraints, or interfaces.\n- The schema definitions should be strictly followed to categorize the relations accurately. \n\nThis approach ensures that the task is completed systematically and accurately."

This implies a requirement constraint between the Center and the Target Ramp Meter, as well as the Plan. Additionally, it implies a requirement reference between the user and the Ramp Meter. There is no mention of an interface.
