You need to identify the relations that match the schema types ('Interface', 'Requirements Reference', 'Requirements Constraint') and return them in a JSON string format. If a relation does not exist, return an empty list for that relation type.\n\n## Guidelines\n- The schema types are 'Interface', 'Requirements Reference', and 'Requirements Constraint'.\n- 'Interface' refers to the data exchange between entities.\n- 'Requirements Reference' refers to the reference between requirements and other entities.\n- 'Requirements Constraint' refers to the constraints between requirements and other entities.\n- The input is a sentence from a software requirements specification and an entity list.\n- The output should be a JSON string with the relation types as keys and lists of relations as values.\n\n## Example Walkthrough\nFor the input: \"However, the simulated environment will be realistic and adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home and to real sensors and controllers.\"\n- The sentence mentions 'actual home', 'sensors', and 'controllers'.\n- The relation 'Requirements Constraint' is identified as the 'actual home' adhering to the physical properties and constraints of the 'sensors' and 'controllers'.\n- The output JSON string is: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': [['an actual home', 'sensors'], ['an actual home', 'controllers']]}\n\n## Solution\n```json\n{\"Phenomena Interface\": [], \"requirements reference\": [], \"requirements constraint\": [[\"an actual home\", \"sensors\"], [\"an actual home\", \"controllers\"]]}\n```"

This means there are two interfaces: one between the DigitalHome Gateway device and the broadband Internet connection, and another between the DigitalHome Gateway device and the DigitalHome devices.

The sentence contains three entities: 'The Gateway', 'an RF Module', and 'sensors and controllers'. The shared phenomena is 'wireless communications'.

The constraints are extracted and listed under the 'requirements constraint' relation. The other relation types do not match the given schema. Therefore, they are left empty. ## Task Description\nYou are an expert specialising in building problem diagrams and entity extraction. Given the sentence from a software requirements specification and an entity list, extract all relation that match the schema definition and return an empty list for non-existent relation types. Please answer in the format of a JSON string.\n\n## Schema Definition\n- 'Interface': is an interface of sending/receiving data between the connected entities.\n- 'Requirements Reference': is a reference relation between requirements domain and other entities.\n- 'Requirements Constraint': is a constrain relation between requirements domain and other entities. It means the requirements domains do not just refer to the phenomena but constrain them.\n\n## Examples\nInput: When the Tactical Control System software is halted due to an unplanned power interruption as well as abnormal program termination, then the Tactical Control System shall enter the Recovery Startup Mode upon application of power.\nEntity: {'Software System': ['Tactical Control System software', 'Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nInput: The ability to attempt recovery from failure or hot-swapped hardware devices will be built into this system.\nEntity: {'Software System': ['this system'], 'Physical Device': ['hot-swapped hardware devices'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['recovery from failure'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [['this system', 'hot-swapped hardware devices']], 'requirements reference': [['this system', 'recovery from failure']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nInput: In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the CCTNS system (with inline synchronization) within no more than <xx> hours.\nEntity: {'Software System': ['the CCTNS system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nInput: The Tactical Control System in the Recovery Startup Mode shall provide the system functionality to resume the Operations.\nEntity: {'Software System': ['Tactical Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['to resume the Operations'], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [['Tactical Control System', 'to resume the Operations']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nInput: The software part of the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System shall be able to perform without total system restart due to internal failure between system maintenance windows.\nEntity: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []}\nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nInput: There shall be a redundant communication path between the Master Correlator Control Computer and Correlator Power Control Computer to provide for remote reboot in the event of a networking or computing failure.\nEntity: {'Software System': [], 'Physical Device': ['the Master Correlator Control Computer', 'Correlator Power Control Computer'], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['to provide for remote reboot'], 'Shared Phenomena': ['a redundant communication path']}\nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [['the Master Correlator Control Computer', 'a redundant communication path'], ['Correlator Power Control Computer', 'a redundant communication path']], 'requirements reference': [['the Master Correlator Control Computer', 'to provide for remote reboot'], ['Correlator Power Control Computer', 'to provide for remote reboot']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n\nInput: The Correlator Monitor and Control System shall monitor correlator and correlator subsystem health and take corrective action autonomously to recover from hardware and computing system faults.\nEntity: {'Software System': ['The Correlator Monitor and Control System'], 'Physical Device':"
