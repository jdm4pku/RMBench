The schema defines the types of relations and their meanings. The input includes a sentence and a list of entities, and the output should be a JSON string containing the extracted relations.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Identify the Entities and Relations**: The input sentence and the list of entities are provided. The task is to identify the relations that match the schema definitions.\n2. **Extract the Relations**:\n   - **Interface**: This relation involves data passing between entities.\n   - **Requirements Reference**: This relation involves a reference to a requirement by another entity.\n   - **Requirements Constraint**: This relation involves a constraint on a requirement by another entity.\n\n### Solution\nLet's analyze the given input and extract the relations:\n\n**Input:**\n- Sentence: \"The user's score must be kept as local data within the Space Fractions system so that the results may be given at the end of the Space Fractions system.\"\n- Entities: \n  - Software System: ['the Space Fractions system', 'the Space Fractions system']\n  - Physical Device: []\n  - Environment Object: ['The user']\n  - External System: []\n  - System Requirements: []\n  - Shared Phenomena: ['score']\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Interface**: The sentence mentions that the user's score is kept as local data within the Space Fractions system. This implies a data interface between the user and the system.\n- **Requirements Reference**: The sentence does not explicitly reference any requirements.\n- **Requirements Constraint**: The sentence mentions that the score must be kept as local data, which is a constraint on the system.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [\n    [\"the Space Fractions system\", \"score\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [\n    [\"the Space Fractions system\", \"score\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [\n    [\"the Space Fractions system\", \"score\"]\n  ],\n  \"requirements reference\": [],\n  \"requirements constraint\": [\n    [\"the Space Fractions system\", \"score\"]\n  ]\n}\n```"
