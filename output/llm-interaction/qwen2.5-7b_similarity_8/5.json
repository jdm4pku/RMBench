The system acquires telemetry data via NISN, processes it into IDFS data sets, distributes these data sets to the ASPERA-3 team, provides web-based displays of the most current data for public view, stores the telemetry and IDFS data sets on a local SwRI archive, and submits the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets to PDS for long-term archival. \n\n- **Phenomena Interface**: The APAF data system interfaces with the telemetry data, the data, and the current data.

It also interfaces with the telemetry data again for clarity.\n- **Requirements Reference**: The APAF data system references the IDFS data sets and the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets.\n- **Requirements Constraint**: There are no constraints mentioned in the sentence.\n\nThus, the JSON string accurately captures the relations as per the schema definition and the input sentence.

The validation and archiving process implies a reference to the ASPERA-3 scientific data, but no specific constraint is mentioned, so the 'requirements constraint' field will also be empty.

The mnemonic PR is used to indicate the type of requirement, but it does not establish an interface, reference, or constraint between entities. Therefore, the answer is an empty list for all relation types. ##\n\n## Test\nInput:For the user to be able to access the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System, the system must provide a user interface that allows the user to enter their credentials and initiate the authentication process.\nEntities: {'Software System': ['the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []} Answer:{'Phenomena Interface': [['the user', 'a user interface'], ['the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System', 'a user interface']], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': []} \n## Rationale\nThe sentence describes an interface between the user and the system, where the user interface is provided by the system to allow the user to enter their credentials and initiate the authentication process. This matches the 'Interface' relation type. There is no reference or constraint relation mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the answer includes the 'Phenomena Interface' relation with the specified entities. ##\n\n## Test\nInput:The system must ensure that the user's access to the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System is restricted to only the functionalities that are necessary for their role.\nEntities: {'Software System': ['the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': ['the user'], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []} Answer:{'Phenomena Interface': [], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': [['the user', 'the EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System']]} \n## Rationale\nThe sentence specifies a constraint relation where the user's access to the system is restricted to only the necessary functionalities for their role.

    "predict": " \nAnswer: {'Phenomena Interface': [['APAF', 'ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry'], ['APAF', 'ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry']], 'requirements reference': [['meeting MEX mission goals and objectives', 'ASPERA-3 team'], ['meeting MEX mission goals and objectives', 'ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry'], ['meeting MEX mission goals and objectives', 'ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry']], 'requirements constraint': []}\n## Rationale\nThe sentence mentions that APAF-generated intermediate files are to be provided to the ASPERA-3 Co-I's and the ASPERA-3 team to support their meeting of MEX mission goals and objectives. This implies a data flow (phenomena interface) from APAF to the ASPERA-3 Co-I's and the ASPERA-3 team, as well as a reference to the ASPERA-3 team's mission goals and objectives. There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the sentence. \n\nThe sentence also mentions that the files are to be provided within 24 hours of acquiring the telemetry, which implies a time constraint on the data flow, but this is not captured in the schema as a 'Requirements Constraint'. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"APAF\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"], [\"APAF\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry\"]], \"requirements reference\": [[\"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives\", \"ASPERA-3 team\"], [\"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"], [\"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry\"]], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n``` \nThis JSON string correctly identifies the phenomena interfaces and requirements references as per the schema. ## Answer\n```json\n{\"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"APAF\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"], [\"APAF\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry\"]], \"requirements reference\": [[\"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives\", \"ASPERA-3 team\"], [\"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry\"], [\"meeting MEX mission goals and objectives\", \"ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry\"]], \"requirements constraint\": []}\n``` ##"
