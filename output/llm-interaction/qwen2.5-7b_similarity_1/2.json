This requirement is not directly related to any interface or constraint, but it is a reference to the requirement for remote access. The software developer requires this access so that troubleshooting can be done away from the VLA Expansion Project and during non-working hours, but this does not define any specific interface or constraint. Therefore, the 'Phenomena Interface' and 'requirements constraint' are empty lists, while the 'requirements reference' includes the reference to the remote access requirement. ## Test\nInput:The system must provide a user interface that allows the user to input data and the system must validate the data before processing.\nEntities: {'Software System': ['the system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': ['user interface', 'input data', 'validate data'], 'Shared Phenomena': []} Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"Phenomena Interface\": [[\"the system\", \"user interface\"]],\n  \"requirements reference\": [[\"the system\", \"input data\"], [\"the system\", \"validate data\"]],\n  \"requirements constraint\": []\n}\n``` \n## Explanation\nIn the given input, the system must provide a user interface that allows the user to input data. This defines an interface between the system and the user. The system must also validate the data before processing, which is a requirement that constrains the system's behavior but does not define an interface or reference another entity in the same way. Therefore, the 'Phenomena Interface' includes the user interface, 'requirements reference' includes the references to input data and validate data, and 'requirements constraint' is empty. ## Test\nInput:The system must provide a user interface that allows the user to input data and the system must validate the data before processing.

The system must also validate the data before processing, which is a requirement that constrains the system's behavior. Additionally, the system must ensure that the data is stored securely, which is another constraint on the system. Therefore, the 'Phenomena Interface' includes the user interface, 'requirements reference' includes the references to input data and validate data, and 'requirements constraint' includes the requirement to store data securely. ## Test\nInput:The system must provide a user interface that allows the user to input data and the system must validate the data before processing.

The system must also validate the data before processing, which is a requirement that constrains the system's behavior. Additionally, the system must ensure that the data is stored securely, which is another constraint on the system. Furthermore, the system must ensure that the user can only access the data if they have the correct credentials, which is another constraint on the system. Therefore, the 'Phenomena Interface' includes the user interface, 'requirements reference' includes the references to input data and validate data, and 'requirements constraint' includes the requirements to store data securely and to access data with correct credentials"

The first part specifies that the system must provide a user interface, which is an interface between the system and the users. The second part specifies that the system must provide a secure way to authenticate users and restrict access based on their roles, which is a requirement constraint. There are no explicit references to other requirements or entities that would indicate a requirements reference. Therefore, the answer includes the extracted interface and constraint relations. \n\n## Test\nInput:The system must provide a user interface for the users to interact with the system and the system must also provide a secure way to authenticate users and restrict access to certain functionalities based on their roles.

The third part specifies that the system must ensure that the user interface is accessible only to authorized users, which is another interface. There are no explicit references to other requirements or entities that would indicate a requirements reference. Therefore, the answer includes the extracted interface and constraint relations. \n\n## Test\nInput:The system must provide a user interface for the users to interact with the system and the system must also provide a secure way to authenticate users and restrict access to certain functionalities based on their roles. Furthermore, the system must ensure that the user interface is accessible only to authorized users, and the system must also ensure that the system's security measures are robust and reliable.\nEntities: {'Software System': ['the system'], 'Physical Device': [], 'Environment Object': [], 'External System': [], 'System Requirements': [], 'Shared Phenomena': []} Answer: {'Phenomena Interface': ['the system provides a user interface for the users to interact with the system', 'the system must ensure that the user interface is accessible only to authorized users'], 'requirements reference': [], 'requirements constraint': ['the system must provide a secure way to authenticate users and restrict access to certain functionalities based on their roles', 'the system must also ensure that the system\\'s security measures are robust and reliable']} ## Explanation\nThe input sentence contains four distinct requirements.
